"Next-Gen Fracturing: How Repsol and ExxonMobil Are Using Data, Iteration To Optimize Well Performance",https://jpt.spe.org/next-gen-fracturing-how-repsol-and-exxonmobil-are-using-data-iteration-to-optimize-well-performance-restricted,"The oil and gas industry is writing a new chapter for hydraulic fracturing operations, defined by data, iteration, and a relentless pursuit of efficiency. In the Marcellus, an operator leveraged legacy data to refine its next-generation completions, while in the Permian, a four-well campaign showcased the power of iterative learning on successfully drilling out 4-mile laterals. Both highlight the industry’s growing reliance on data and experience to unlock value. Targeted analysis of legacy Marcellus well data is helping Repsol shape its next-generation completion designs in the region for optimal business impact. Completions experts from Repsol analyzed data from two pads in the Marcellus to assess whether previous completions strategies—such as well spacing, completion intensity, and the number of clusters treated at once—delivered the expected results. They detailed their sometimes counterintuitive findings in SPE 223577. The research evolved from the question of which variables in the operator’s Generation 2 completions designs, used from 2021 through 2023, drive production results, Stephane Pichon, technical advisor at Repsol, said while presenting the paper at SPE’s Hydraulic Fracturing Technical Conference and Exhibition (HFTC) in February. The operator reviewed existing data from legacy pads, he said, and while the data indicated that about 70% of the clusters in certain wells were producing, the data didn’t indicate why the other 30% were underperforming. “It’s a bit of a disappointment” if reactive data acquisition fails to provide the answers being sought, he said. Analyzing data on the direction of perforations shots—whether from top to bottom, as is typically done, or from the side—revealed “interesting information” that raised the question of whether “we were shooting in the wrong direction,” he said. According to the paper, shooting perforations on the sides results in a 10% reduction in horsepower-hour consumption, easier pump-rate ramp-up, lower treating pressure, and higher pump rate. This approach also resulted in reduced resource usage and lower emissions. The next step for Repsol was to move toward proactive data acquisition.

"BP Signs Deal To Rehab Iraq’s Kirkuk Oil Assets, Boost Production",https://jpt.spe.org/bp-signs-deal-to-rehab-iraqs-kirkuk-oil-assets-boost-production,"In a deal described as possibly ""one of the most important transactions BP has done in 20 years"" by CEO Murray Auchincloss, the company has agreed contractual terms with the Iraqi government to invest in drilling and infrastructure to rehabilitate and boost production at the Kirkuk oil field and three adjacent fields in the northeastern part of the country starting this year. He added, during an investor call on 26 February, that the field's ""huge resource base, low lifting cost, low development cost"" offers ""a tremendous opportunity for us to use our big field management skills. ""I feel this is a magnificently aligned structure and I think in 10 years' time we'll look back on this as one of the most important transactions BP has done in 20 years,"" Auchincloss said. Finalized on 25 February, the deal obligates BP and Baghdad to form an unincorporated organization to function as a new operator with personnel drawn mostly from the North Oil Company (NOC) and North Gas Company (NGC), along with secondees from BP. BP will create a separate standalone incorporated joint venture to hold its interests in the new operator which will take over Kirkuk operations from NOC, according to a BP press release. The agreement, which now goes to Iraq’s Council of Ministers for approval, concludes months of negotiations that started with the signing of a memorandum of understanding between BP and Iraq in July 2024. Technical terms were agreed in December and most commercial terms were sorted in January taking into consideration BP’s previous work in Kirkuk from 2013 to 2019. The agreement aims to raise oil and gas production by more than 3 billion BOE at the Baba and Avanah domes of the Kirkuk oil field and three adjacent fields – Bai Hassan, Jambur, and Khabbaz, all currently operated by NOC. The deal spans oil, gas, power, and water and opens potential opportunities to invest in exploration given that the wider resource opportunity across the contract and surrounding area is believed to include up to 20 billion BOE, according to BP. BP executive vice president William Lin noted that the agreement “builds on our longstanding and strategic relationship with the Government of Iraq” and aligns fully “with our priority of pursuing new growth opportunities” to strengthen BP’s global portfolio. Under the agreement, BP will develop a drilling program together with NOC, NGC and the new operator, rehabilitate existing wells and facilities, and build new infrastructure, including gas expansion projects. BP’s remuneration will be linked to incremental production volumes, prices, and costs with BP allowed to book a share of production and reserves proportionate to the fees it earns for helping to increase production, the company said in a news release. BP was a member of the consortium of oil companies that discovered oil in Kirkuk in the 1920s. From 2013 to 2019 BP worked with the Ministry of Oil and NOC on technical studies exploring the potential for redevelopment at Kirkuk. Media reports have estimated the value of BP’s investment at $25 billion; BP has not confirmed that number. Leaders in Iraq’s semiautonomous Kurdistan region denounced the agreement, arguing that they had a right to join the negotiations. However, Iraq did agree on 23 February to allow Kurdistan to export its existing oil production through the Iraq-Turkey pipeline, thus partially addressing the financial issue. A year ago, Iraqi’s Oil Minister Hayan Abdul-Ghani set a target to boost Iraq’s oil reserves to160 billion bbl. Growth in production capacity is targeted at 6 million B/D by 2028, Arabian Gulf Business Insight reported in September, citing government sources. In late January, Iraq announced the discovery of a new oil field in the southern East Baghdad group of fields in central Iraq that may add 2 billion bbl of medium and light crude to the country’s oil reserves. In Basrah, Iraq’s southernmost oil producing region, TotalEnergies awarded engineering firm Wood a 3-year, $46 million front-end engineering and design contract in July covering the initial phase of the Gas Growth Integrated Project to recover flare gas.

Case Study • Beyond Acid: Advancing Unconventional Reservoir Recovery With Chemical Restimulation,https://jpt.spe.org/case-study-beyond-acid-advancing-unconventional-reservoir-recovery-with-chemical-restimulation,"As unconventional reservoirs mature, operators are increasingly looking for innovative methods to enhance production from existing wells. Traditional stimulation techniques, such as acid treatments, have been borrowed from conventional reservoirs, but their effectiveness in tight shale formations is often limited. An alternative approach gaining traction is chemical restimulation, which aims to improve well productivity by addressing near-wellbore damage, restoring fracture conductivity, and optimizing fluid flow through targeted chemical treatments. Unlike acid jobs, which primarily rely on wellbore scale dissolution, chemical restimulation can be tailored to the specific conditions of a reservoir, making it a more versatile and scalable solution. By utilizing low dose rates of chemistry, larger volumes can economically be injected allowing for contact of the fractures and facture-matrix interface. This article explores the advantages of chemical restimulation over acid treatments, highlighting how it can improve production economics and extend the productive life of unconventional wells. As operators manage their well inventory development more carefully, the industry seeks innovative methods to increase production from existing wells. This has led some well operators to borrow methods from conventional reservoirs and attempt to use acid treatments to stimulate production on existing wells. Acid, particularly hydrochloric acid (HCl), has an extensive history of being used for stimulation of conventional carbonate reservoirs and to dissolve acid-soluble scales in the wellbore. Translating the use of acid to stimulate horizontal, multistage fractured wells in tight formations presents numerous challenges. One way to measure the productivity of an unconventional well is dimensionless conductivity, as shown in this equation: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Eq. 1) Where: kf = fracture permeability w = fracture width k = matrix permeability xf = fracture half-length The primary mechanism for acid to increase fracture conductivity is to enhance matrix permeability through the dissolution of carbonate minerals. Therefore, understanding the reservoir mineralogy is critical. For example, the Eagle Ford formation located in south Texas is calcite- and clay-rich, quartz-poor with carbonate content upwards of 70% by volume (SPE 165689). This is contrasted with the Wolfcamp A formation located in the Permian Basin which is an organic-rich siliceous shale where over 60% of the rock is quartz and feldspar with the balance composed of clays and carbonate minerals (URTeC 2901968). The probability that an acid-stimulation treatment will contact facies with high carbonate content will vary by reservoir and, more importantly, the acid volume that would be required to contact the matrix is significant. One method to frame the required volume is by using the fracture pore volume (FPV) which utilizes the proppant used during the completion to estimate volume within the propped fractures (URTeC 3867194). Assuming a modern completion has a perforated interval of 10,000 ft and a proppant intensity of 2,000 lbm/ft, the FPV is 11,500 bbl. Acid-treatment volumes typically cannot economically exceed 1,000 bbl, presenting the challenge of meaningfully contacting any matrix rock. With limited ability to improve matrix permeability, the dominant mechanism of using acid in unconventional wells is dissolution of scales. Scale deposition is a real challenge, but its prevalence will vary not only across different formations but even within the same reservoir. Scale deposition is typically contained to the wellbore, and in a 10,000-ft lateral, the wellbore volume is approximately 200 bbl. Therefore, at most, 200 bbl of acid would be required for scale dissolution, and it is likely that less is needed as it is improbable the entire wellbore is full of scale. Unlike acid treatments that primarily dissolve acid-soluble scales, chemical restimulation treatments address multiple production-hindering factors such as fracture conductivity degradation, wettability alteration, capillary phase trapping, and scale deposition (Table 1). By leveraging surfactants, acids, chelators, and/or solvents, chemical treatments improve fracture conductivity, enhance fluid flow, and clean the wellbore more effectively. Chemical restimulation treatments utilize chemistry at low dose rates and relatively low acid volumes allowing for the economic injection of significantly larger volumes than acid jobs. Chemical restimulation treatment volumes will vary with proppant intensity, but a typical volume will be between 5,000 to 15,000 bbl allowing for penetration into the propped fracture network and limited penetration into the matrix. A critical aspect of these treatments is the use of chemical diverter to improve fluid distribution along the lateral. This allows for no mechanical intervention and injection from surface, significantly reducing the cost of these treatments. An Eagle Ford well located in south Texas, completed in 2013, was subjected to an acid treatment in 2024 after experiencing a fracture-driven interaction (FDI). The original completion featured a 3,532-ft perforated interval with 12 fracture stages and 2.4 million lbm of proppant. The calculated fracture pore volume was 687 bbl, and the wellbore volume was 344 bbl. The treatment plan included 800 bbl of 15% HCl and 800 bbl of water with additives such as a corrosion inhibitor, iron control agent, and nonemulsifier. Due to cost constraints, the acid volume was relatively small compared to the FPV, even in an older completion with low proppant intensity. To enhance coverage, chemical diversion technology was employed. The treatment was executed in April 2024, and we observed limited surface pressure response during injection. The well returned to production in May 2024. The pre-FDI oil-production rate was approximately 20 B/D of oil and has now leveled out at 10 B/D while also observing a drop in gas from 60 to 30 MMscf/D (Fig. 1). Overall, the acid treatment appeared to have limited impact on the damage caused by the FDI, with production still being adversely affected by it. Kairos performed a chemical restimulation treatment on a three-well pad in the Eagle Ford (Fig. 2), where all wells had experienced FDI hits. The wells, completed in 2017, collectively lost about 50 B/D due to FDI-driven interactions. The treatment designs focused on expanding the effective treatment volume beyond the wellbore and into the propped fractures and fracture-matrix interface. The approach combined a surfactant, acid-solvent blend, and diversion technology to address damage mechanisms such as wettability alteration, capillary phase trapping, and scale deposition. Key design parameters included: Lab testing determined that 1 gpt of surfactant provided optimal performance. It reduced oil/water interfacial tension by two orders of magnitude, lowered surface tension by 50%, and decreased the oil-contact angle by 40%. Additionally, 5,000 gal of acid-solvent chemistry were used—using only 15% of the volume in the acid-only treatment—to target scale and paraffin deposits. Diversion played a crucial role in distributing treatment fluids across the lateral. Pressure-response analysis indicated successful stage-by-stage diversion, ensuring even chemical placement. Following the treatments, the three wells’ oil production increased by approximately 50 B/D, returning to pre-FDI trends. The decline rate stabilized, resulting in sustained incremental production. With a net oil price of $65/bbl and gas at $2.05/MMscf of gas, the three-well treatment program paid back in 70 days. A new well located in the Powder River Basin in Wyoming came online at 700 B/D. However, production quickly declined, and a “gummy bear”-like material was collected from the separator. Lab analysis of the solid showed it was primarily composed of iron and the polyacrylamide friction reducer. This is prevalent in iron-rich formations where high molecular weight polyacrylamide friction reducers are used (Rassenfoss, JPT). Historically, citric acid in concentrations of 5 to 15% were used to remediate this type of damage. Citric acid is expensive, limiting the volume that can be economically injected. Since the friction reducer moves with the proppant into the fractures, the formation of this material extends beyond the wellbore. The operator conducted three separate 10% citric acid jobs with volumes ranging from 200 to 500 bbl. In each case, the production post-treatment was briefly restored and then fell off, followed by additional gummy bear production. A lab dissolution study was initiated to study the dissolution of the material using various chelator-based chemistries. A chemistry blend of chelators and scale inhibitors demonstrated comparable performance in dissolving the sample to 10% citric acid, but at a dose rate of 5,000 ppm. This represents a two-order-of-magnitude reduction in the chemistry dose rate compared to 10% citric acid, enabling the economic injection of significantly higher volumes. The FPV of the well was 2,200 bbl, and a treatment volume of 2,700 bbl, comprising chelator and surfactant with a diverter, was designed to distribute fluid throughout the fracture network. Post-treatment, the well returned to a production rate of approximately 400 B/D and sustained that production for more than 9 months with no gummy production (Fig. 3). This case study demonstrates that using optimized chemistry in an engineered chemical restimulation treatment can enhance the economics of unconventional production. While acid treatments have proven effective in conventional carbonate formations, their application in unconventional reservoirs is inherently limited. The significant volumes of acid required to contact the matrix rock means the primary role of acid in these wells is limited to wellbore scale removal rather than meaningful reservoir stimulation. Given these challenges, alternative chemical restimulation techniques offer a more viable solution for enhancing production in unconventional reservoirs. By leveraging advanced chemical formulations tailored to the specific properties of the reservoir, operators can achieve more effective, scalable, and economically viable production enhancement strategies. As the industry continues to seek optimized approaches for maturing assets, chemical restimulation stands out as a promising alternative to traditional acid treatments.

Kuwait Petroleum To Boost Oil Production Capacity 33% by 2040,https://jpt.spe.org/kuwait-petroleum-to-boost-oil-production-capacity-33-by-2040,"Kuwait Petroleum Corp. (KPC) aims to raise its domestic oil production capacity 33% by 2040 while boosting operational efficiencies to lower cost per barrel and reducing emissions to stay on track to net zero. In a podcast interview ahead of 2025 CERAWeek by S&P Global, Bader Al Attar, managing director of planning and finance at KPC, discussed how the company will invest to balance production growth with emphasis on sustainability to keep Kuwait’s 90-year-old oil industry producing for as long as demand for crude remains. Since 2005, KPC and its subsidiary, Kuwait Oil Co. (KOC), have reduced flaring from 17% to just 0.5%. As part of their ongoing efforts to lower their carbon footprint, they are using carbon capture technology to enhance oil recovery. Additionally, they are integrating solar power and advanced monitoring and management systems into their operations, as explained by Al Attar in a podcast with Atul Arya, the chief energy strategist at S&P Global. Al Attar said, “… oil and gas will be playing a big role by the year 2050 … and we think that the last companies standing and producing by that time will be the ones with low costs per barrel as well as the low carbon footprint. To that end we see KPC as best positioned.” In its latest World Oil Outlook, released in September 2024, OPEC projected strong medium-term growth in oil demand, expecting it to exceed 120 million B/D by 2050. This increase will be primarily driven by non-OECD countries, with India playing a key role. Petrochemicals will account for the largest incremental increase in oil demand during OPEC’s forecast period at 4.9 million B/D, followed by road transportation (4.6 million B/D), and aviation (4.2 million B/D), according to the report. “We are aspiring to grow our upstream production (capacity) domestically to reach 4 million B/D to 2035 and maintain that until 2040,” Al Attar said, noting that Kuwait is bound by OPEC production quotas when releasing oil into the market. Attar said that Kuwait is targeting its nonassociated gas production at 2 Bscf/D by yearend 2040, refining capacity to 1.6 million B/D, and petrochemicals output to 14.5 mtpa, more than three times its current 4.5 mpta of petrochemical output but achievable through possible M&A opportunities. With the May 2024 commissioning of the Al-Zour refinery, Kuwait has already boosted refining to 1.4 million B/D, Attar said, adding ""there will be a little more (capacity) coming with upgrades to the refinery; I would say we are here"" in terms of Kuwait's having reached its refining goals. In January, Kuwait’s state news agency KUNA announced KOC’s discovery of an estimated 800 million bbl of medium-density oil and 600 billion scf of associated gas at the Al-Jlaiaa offshore field. The news followed an announcement in July 2024 of the discovery of an estimated 3.2 billion BOE of reserves in Kuwait’s Al-Nokhatha field 45 miles east of Failaka Island near the undemarcated maritime boundary with Iran. Both resulted from Kuwait’s extensive exploratory survey project currently ongoing in a 6000-km2 area to find new hydrocarbon reserves offshore, a quest that will make or break Kuwait’s aim of meeting its 33% production increase target, according to The Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington, DC. Development of such offshore discoveries is critical to meeting Kuwait’s 4 million B/D target because to raise “or even maintain stable production levels, declines in mature onshore fields need to be compensated with new projects, especially if OPEC+ is able to raise production targets over the next few years,” the Institute reported in July. Moreover, increasing production “would be crucial for Kuwait to demonstrate higher capacity to secure a larger (OPEC quota) as the United Arab Emirates has done,” the article pointed out. In 2024, Kuwait held 8.27% of global oil reserves, according to OPEC’s annual statistics bulletin. Asked about Kuwait’s energy transition strategy, Al Attar said, “we have been on this journey for quite some time,” noting that Kuwait has reduced gas flares to 0.5% from a 2005 high of 17% and “we will keep it around those levels” because it “keeps the environment clean and makes economic sense.” For example, KOC is capturing carbon emissions to increase recovery at Minagish field in western Kuwait, he said. Other examples including using solar power to produce electricity for facilities and field operations including powering electrical submersible pumps in western Kuwait. KPC is also considering business models, Al Attar said, “where maybe we partner with companies that can do this project for us but at the same time to sell us the power to use in our fields for much less price than what we are paying now to generate electricity.” Kuwait plans to invest just under $100 billion over the next 5 years, with about half allocated to the domestic upstream sector. Around 12% will be directed toward international upstream, 20% toward domestic downstream, and 3% for international downstream. Additionally, 10% will be dedicated to petrochemicals and the rest applied where needed, Al Attar said. “Our upstream reservoirs are getting more and more mature, and we see that the stage of maturity of these reservoirs is requiring more and more capital to invest not only to keep production levels where they are but also to grow to where we aspire to the numbers to be,” he said. Kuwait today produces three grades of crude, depending on the reservoir— traditional Kuwait export crude, heavy oil in the 16 to 18 °API range, and a light crude produced in deeper horizons, Al Attar said.

Data and Direction Form Twin Pillars of Effective Digital Transformation,https://jpt.spe.org/data-and-direction-form-twin-pillars-of-effective-digital-transformation,"As powerful as digital technology is, it is only as good as the data—and mission—from which it draws. The industry recognizes the potential digital transformation can bring to operations, but it is also aware that quality data is not enough. Speaking during the “Data-Driven Transformation: Leveraging AI and Digitalization for Operational Efficiency” panel at the International Petroleum Technology Conference in Kuala Lumpur on 19 February, industry experts talked up the possibilities that digital tech offers while urging companies to make sure they don’t fall in love with tech for technology’s sake. Swarup Joshi, Microsoft’s director for energy and resources in Asia, said the best outcomes from deploying digital and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies require specificity about the problem that needs to be solved followed by a laser focus on adoption and embedding the tech. “AI is a tool. There’s been tools that emerged in the past, and they come and go. Sometimes they get embedded. Ultimately, we have to use AI to deliver outcomes for the business, right, whether it’s for assets, for people, for customers,” he said. He compared AI to an iceberg. With AI, he said, “what we can see is a lot of possibility, a lot of potential. We think about accelerating innovation or process optimization,” along with eliminating drudgery and increasing staff productivity, he said. “But, at the same time, as we go forward as an industry together, we’ve got to manage for a bunch of other things” that are below the surface, such as AI governance, data foundations, security, adoption and change management, employee skilling, responsible AI, moving from proving to scaling, defining success measures, and value realization. Generative AI as a technology has already had a tremendous effect at the personal level, he said, adding that it can make processes and workflows faster or better. And looking to the future, Joshi said the “next wave of potential” might arise from bringing together different subdomains or data sets. Krish Krishnan, general manager for KBB operations for ConocoPhillips Malaysia, said digitalization and AI have already contributed to business efficiencies the company has realized. Getting there, he said, started with a mission and required quality data. “The opportunity is primarily on how we exploit digital technologies and that make our assets and processes more intelligent and automated,” he said. The differentiator is “how do we make our assets more automated, and how do we make it smarter to reduce the burden” on staff, he added. High-quality and accessible data is critical, he said. “Data itself is a whole topic, and it’s very important because it all starts with data. And then you go into infrastructure and platforms because you have to have the right infrastructure and platforms to deal with data,” Krishnan said. “Then, ultimately, once you sort that out … do you have the right algorithms to assess the data, analyze the data, and then make the right decisions?” Along the digitalization path, it’s important to realize the tech is “a work in progress and requires further evolution and development,” he said. David Reed, Weatherford’s executive vice president and chief commercial officer, said AI can generate value through the context of collect, contextualize, calculate, and control. Over the years, the industry has collected increasing amounts of data, which can be contextualized through unified data models. The data feeds into physics-based and empirical analyses calculations, and supervisory control and data acquisition systems control operations. “The challenge we’ve had over the last 10 plus years is: Great, we have the data. But what do we do with it?” he said. “Data is only good if we understand what it is, and then we can make the decisions from it.” In short, he said, it must be contextualized and used in calculations that ultimately improve operations. In one example that Reed cited from Australia, AI was able to help optimize production by 86% over 5,000 wells with negligible capital and operational expenditures. Before the AI-based workflow was in place, humans evaluated and made operations decisions on five to 10 wells a day, he said. The AI workflow can evaluate each of the 5,000 wells hourly and generate diagnostics and insights, he said. “There’s a lot of opportunity to use data exceptionally well,” he said. Porpich Pongparnish, vice president for digital at Chevron Thailand Exploration and Production, said one of the keys to working with technology, whether it’s AI, drones, or robot dogs, is to keep a focus on what matters. “We need to start with the business value—the business value. Don’t fall in love with technology,” she said. The operator has used AI in “nearly every aspect of the value chain,” she said and noted it’s helping understand the behavior of critical offshore assets. AI and generative AI are evolving and how people work with these technologies must evolve as well, she said. One of the future opportunities she sees is connecting data and AI capabilities across multiple workflows. “Right now, sometimes we just focus on a single workflow; but, there is a gap. There is a hidden secret between two or three workflows. How can we connect with the data and AI?” she asked. The operator also plans to use other technologies in the field. Autonomous drone and robot dog pilots are expected to “help us inspect and understand the conditions” of assets and fields in the near future, she said. Sinthu Satawiriya, head of ventures for PTTEP spinoff AI and Robotics Ventures, said that the industry “wants to have physical AI” instead of just processes and analytics. Physical AI would operate physically in the real world, he said, but the interface for that is important. The company’s MARS wellhead robot for offshore operations has an arm that can take corrective action such as turning valves, he said. The idea behind the robot, he said, is to “reduce the spread offshore,” saving money and reducing risk.

"Eni, Petronas Propose JV To Combine Upstream Assets in Indonesia and Malaysia",https://jpt.spe.org/eni-petronas-propose-jv-to-combine-upstream-assets-in-indonesia-and-malaysia,"Italian major Eni and Malaysia’s national champion Petronas have signed an exclusive memorandum of understanding (MOU) to create a joint venture holding company to oversee selected upstream assets in Indonesia and Malaysia. The standalone company would invest in, and raise external financing, for new gas development and infrastructure projects to create synergies to grow the new entity into “a major LNG player in the region,” the partners said in a 27 February news release. Reacting to the news, Wood MacKenzie’s vice president for corporate research, Asia Pacific, Andrew Harwood, went further, suggesting that if successful, the tie- up “would create a new Southeast Asian ‘Major’” combining Eni’s industry-leading exploration capabilities with Petronas’ regional presence. The proposed JV would combine approximately 3 billion BOE of reserves with an additional 10 billion BOE of potential exploration upside while delivering in the medium term a sustainable 500,000 BOED of production, Eni and Petronas said in their announcement. Though the assets to be selected remain a mystery, Wood Mackenzie is betting that choices will focus on Indonesia, including Eni’s holdings in the Kutei Basin and Petronas’ stake in the Abadi LNG development led by Japan’s Inpex. In its release, WoodMac said it expects Petronas to also “contribute production and exploration assets in Sarawak and Sabah from its domestic portfolio. Petronas’ largest domestic producing asset is the SK316 block in Sarawak, which includes the Kasawari development.” Eni and Petronas said they will develop a business plan to capture future opportunities in exploration, development, and portfolio growth. WoodMac’s Harwood suggests that “this proposed joint venture is more innovative and broader in scope than the industry anticipated.” Eni has employed its “satellite model” to structure successful ventures in Angola (Azule Energy, in partnership with BP), Norway (Var Energi), and the UK (Ithaca), aiming to unlock value from noncore assets unable to attract capital from within a larger portfolio. But while the method is similar, the driving force differs in the case of Southeast Asia. Harwood pointed out that “due to the successful capture of organic and inorganic growth opportunities, Indonesia is set to become one of the largest producing countries in Eni’s global portfolio by the early 2030s. “Managing capital commitments, unlocking new growth opportunities, and broadening strategic relationships are the key drivers behind the formation of the new venture,” he said, adding, “For Southeast Asia, the creation of a new technically capable and well-funded operator, with a mandate to pursue new growth, could be the key required to unlock the region’s significant untapped potential.” Under the arrangement, assets folded into the JV will retain their current operational structure, with a focus on health, safety, and environment, project delivery and efficiency, while both companies continue to uphold their sustainability commitments, according to the partners. Eni and Petronas aim to ensure stability in production for Malaysian assets while supporting new developments in Indonesia, according to the announcement. Any final transaction will be subject to relevant governmental, regulatory, and partner approvals, the partners said.

"Mero Becomes Petrobras' Third Field To Reach 500,000 B/D",https://jpt.spe.org/mero-becomes-petrobras-third-field-to-reach-500-000-b-d,"Petrobras announced this week that crude output from its deepwater Mero field reached 500,000 B/D. The milestone, reached on 28 February, makes Mero the Brazilian national oil company’s third pre-salt field to reach the milestone figure after the larger Tupi and Búzios projects. Petrobras said 81% of its production comes from these pre-salt fields in the Santos Basin. The Mero development began production in 2017 and now includes four floating production, storage, and offloading (FPSO) units. The project also features Brazil’s largest FPSO, the Guanabara which has a processing capacity of 180,000 B/D and a storage capacity of 1.4 million bbl. Discovered in 2010, the Mero field lies in 2100 m of water, about 180 km offshore Rio de Janeiro. Located within the Libra block in the Santos Basin, Mero was acquired by the Libra Consortium in 2013 under Brazil’s first production-sharing contract. “Since extracting its first oil, Mero’s production has been marked by technological advances, innovation, and production records. The 500,000 B/D mark is the result of the work of several areas and the new technologies used in our projects and in our day-to-day operations,” said Magda Chambriard, CEO of Petrobras in a statement. Petrobras said it will reach a production capacity of 770,000 B/D from the field later this year when a fifth FPSO, the Alexandre de Gusmão, begins operations. The vessel left China in December 2024 and is en route to Brazil. Production at the FPSO Marechal Duque de Caxias is being ramped up to full capacity, according to the company. Also designed to process up to 180,000 B/D of crude and store 1.4 million bbl, it is the first FPSO in the world to integrate high-pressure separation technology (HISEP). HISEP is an advanced system developed by TechnipFMC for Petrobras to separate CO₂-rich gas from production streams and reinject it into the reservoir to lower greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, Marechal Duque de Caxias features water alternating gas reinjection technology and a system for stripping and reinjecting CO₂ from fuel gas production, with the capability to compress up to 48 MMscfd of CO₂. Petrobras’ Buzios field, the second largest in Brazil, reached 800,000 B/D of production on 24 February. The largest field, Tupi, is currently producing over 830,000 B/D with the company planning to raise its production to 1 million B/D by 2027. The Mero field is operated by Petrobras, which holds a 38.6% interest, alongside partners Shell (19.3%), TotalEnergies (19.3%), CNOOC (9.65%), and CNPC (9.65%). Pré-Sal Petróleo SA (3.5%) serves as the project manager.

"BP Transitions Back, Ramps Up Oil and Gas Spending",https://jpt.spe.org/bp-transitions-back-ramps-up-oil-and-gas-spending,"It was 5 years ago this February, BP became the first supermajor to commit to net-zero emissions by 2050 or sooner. In fact, the London-based oil and gas giant went even further, announcing plans to cut oil and gas production by 40% compared with 2019 levels. This pledge came under former CEO Bernard Looney, who resigned in 2023. He was succeeded early last year by Murray Auchincloss, who is now steering the company's latest energy transition—this time back toward oil and gas production growth. BP is reshaping its investment priorities, channeling more capital into oil and gas while lowering transition spending to $1.5 billion–$2 billion annually—$5 billion less than initially planned. “We will grow upstream investment and production to allow us to produce high-margin energy for years to come. We will focus our downstream on markets where we have leading integrated positions. And we will be very selective in our investment in the transition, including through innovative capital-light platforms. This is a reset BP, with an unwavering focus on growing long-term shareholder value,” Auchincloss said in a statement released with the announcement. The decision to retreat from renewables comes less than 3 weeks after Equinor announced plans to cut its renewable energy investments by 50% to $5 billion over the next 2 years while shifting greater focus to oil and gas production. The Norwegian company expects more than 10% growth in oil and gas output from 2024 to 2027. BP’s earnings have taken a hit in recent years and the company is seeking to regain investor confidence after underperforming compared with peers Shell, Chevron, and ExxonMobil. It is also facing pressure to make transformative change from activist investor Elliott Investment Management after it built a significant stake in the company. BP’s new direction places “free cash flow growth, returns, and value at its heart,” said BP Chairman Helge Lund in a statement. The company aims to achieve more than 20% compound annual growth in free cash flow and improve returns on capital employed to over 16% by 2027. It expects strong cash flow generation and proceeds from divestments to help lower net debt to between $14 and $18 billion by the end of that year. To execute its plan, BP aims to spend between $13biliion and $15 billion annually through 2027, trimming between $1 billion and $3 billion from 2024 levels, with 2025 capital expenditure expected at around $15 billion. The company plans to invest around $10 billion in oil and gas, which is 20% higher than its previous guidance, enabling the company to build higher-returning projects and increase exploration activities. BP expects to start 10 major projects by 2027, with a focus on core regions in Azerbaijan, Trinidad, and the Middle East. In contrast, the company’s renewables sector has plans for only five to seven major projects. “The outcome is an upstream that is growing to 2.3 billion–2.5 million B/D in 2030, with around 1 million BOE/D expected to be delivered from the US, and with the capacity to increase production out to 2035,” said Auchincloss. BP looks to raise its dividend by at least 4% per share annually and expects first-quarter share buybacks between $750 million and $1 billion, a decrease from its previous $1.75 billion forecast. As part of its realignment strategy, BP is exploring the sale of its Castrol lubricant business and looking to bring in a partner to raise proceeds from its Lightsource BP solar business. “We believe we have a world-class portfolio—a top tier oil and gas business in attractive basins, leading integrated positions and brands across the value chain,” Auchincloss said. “Our new strategy plays to these distinctive strengths and competitive advantages.” The Journal of Petroleum Technology, the Society of Petroleum Engineers’ flagship magazine, presents authoritative briefs and features on technology advancements in exploration and production, oil and gas industry issues, and news about SPE and its members.

Vår Energi Finds Oil With Zagato Well in the Barents Sea,https://jpt.spe.org/var-energi-finds-oil-with-zagato-well-in-the-barents-sea,"Vår Energi’s most recent oil discovery of between 15 and 43 million BOE near the Goliat field could be fast-tracked for development. The operator announced the discovery of oil at its operated Zagato exploration well in the Barents Sea on 27 February. The discovery in 410 m water depth is the company’s third consecutive oil find in its operated Goliat area. When combined with the Countach discoveries from 2024, Vår said the high case for total gross estimated recoverable resources is about 100 million BOE. In the Goliat ridge, estimated gross discovered and prospective recoverable resources have increased to more than 200 million BOE, the operator said. “Close proximity to existing infrastructure provides opportunity for a fast-track, low-emission, cost-efficient development utilizing available capacity at the Goliat FPSO,” Vår Energi Chief Operating Officer Torger Rød said in a news release. “With additional wells being drilled this year, we see an opportunity to unlock significant additional resources as tieback projects to Goliat.” Vår said all three wells drilled so far on the Goliat ridge–Countach, Countach appraisal and Zagato–have identified hydrocarbons in separate fault blocks, which de-risks prospectivity in the undrilled areas. The Goliat ridge comprises of a series of adjacent fault-bounded prospects next to the Goliat field. Zagato is 8 km northeast of the Goliat FPSO, and Vår said the good-quality reservoirs found in the exploration wells are similar to those in the producing Goliat field. The operator said new 3D and 4D seismic surveys will be acquired over the area during summer 2025 to complete the remaining potential delineation and accelerate progress to development studies. Once the COSL Prospector finishes operations at Zagato, it will drill infill wells at the Goliat field, including Well 7122/7-8, Goliat Nord, before returning to the ridge area later in the year. In the third quarter of 2025, Vår plans to begin drilling two more exploration or appraisal wells. According to the Norwegian Offshore Directorate (NOD), the Zagato wildcat well, 7122/8-3 S, is the 11th in Production License 229, which was awarded in 1997. The well’s primary exploration target was to prove petroleum in Middle Triassic reservoir rocks in the Kobbe formation. The well’s secondary exploration target was to prove petroleum in Middle/Lower Jurassic reservoir rocks in the Realgrunnen subgroup, the NOD said. In the primary exploration target, Well 7122/8-3 S encountered oil columns totaling 72 m in the Kobbe formation, distributed over three reservoir zones. The reservoir quality varies from good in the upper part to moderate in the lower part, and the oil/water contact was not encountered, according to NOD. In the secondary exploration target, the well encountered a 3-m oil column in the Tubåen formation, with a total thickness of 20 m and very good reservoir quality, NOD said. The oil/water contact was encountered at 1427 m below sea level. Additionally, a 2-m oil column was proven in the Klappmyss formation in a sandstone layer with moderate reservoir quality. While the well was not formation-tested, extensive data acquisition and sampling were carried out, according to NOD. The well was drilled to a vertical depth of 2542 m below sea level, terminated in the Klappmyss formation in the Lower Triassic, and has been temporarily plugged and abandoned. Vår operates both the Zagato and Goliat fields with 65% interest on behalf of partner Equinor with 35% interest.

"In Abu Dhabi, the Oil and Gas Industry Gets a Glimpse of the Future",https://jpt.spe.org/in-abu-dhabi-the-oil-and-gas-industry-gets-a-glimpse-of-the-future,"Over the past 12 months, JPT has celebrated its 75-year anniversary through an anthology of articles highlighting the publication’s long legacy of sharing industry knowledge. Contributions from current and former editors, along with long-time collaborators, provided unique perspectives on the ideas and innovators that have shaped SPE’s flagship publication since its launch in 1949. We encourage you to check out the collection here. As this retrospective series draws to a close, we will sharpen our focus once again on what the future holds for the industry. But first, it’s worth quickly revisiting a period that JPT chronicled extensively in the latter half of the past decade—just before the energy transition became the upstream sector’s top talking point. At that time, the industry was nearly overflowing with excitement about digital transformation and conquering the big data challenge. Large operators moved quickly to hire data scientists, form analytics teams, and partner with emerging software providers offering machine learning platforms with sleek, user-friendly interfaces. JPT spotlighted startups developing chatbots and “cognitive” programs designed to help petroleum engineers retrieve critical production data or predict issues like sand production in wells. Some of the would-be disruptors delivered on their promises, while many pivoted to less-complex industries or faded away. Yet, despite the mixed bag of outcomes, their combined vision for artificial intelligence (AI) in oil and gas looks remarkably prescient, even if slightly ahead of its time. We are now once again swimming in industry optimism thanks to the rapid commercial success of large language models which have unlocked the productivity-boosting power of generative AI. The momentum of this shift was impossible to ignore at the recent Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition and Conference (ADIPEC) in the UAE’s capital, where the SPE served as the technical program organizer. Held over 4 days in November, the 40th edition of this annual event saw more than 205,000 pass through the doors. Event officials declared it a record-breaking crowd for an upstream conference—a milestone that underscores the relevance and resilience of in-person gatherings in a post-pandemic world. Beyond an unprecedented number of human participants, ADIPEC may have also set a new bar for non-sentient ones. Competing for space across the sprawling exhibition was a parade of four‑legged robots, multipurpose drones, virtual reality headset demos, and holographic presenters—apparently based on real people and those digitally created. For seasoned industry conferencegoers, the sight of most of this gadgetry was nothing new, but its abundance likely was. ADIPEC also distinguished itself further as likely becoming the first upstream conference to feature a flying taxi, the recently debuted Tesla Cybertruck, and even a prototype of the electric carmaker’s yet-to-be-released humanoid Tesla Bot—albeit a lifeless, stationary one. But perhaps the most notable harbinger of things to come was hidden inside a 6-ft-tall server rack showcased on the floor by AIQ—a technology joint venture between the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) and Abu Dhabi-based tech firm Presight. Bathed in a purple glow, the silent glass and metal box contained many of the powerful chips that serve as the backbone of the data centers enabling today’s AI resurgence. Now, a lone server rack at an oil and gas conference won’t settle the debate over AI’s ability to redefine the future of petroleum engineering. And if you’re a keen observer of upstream tech trends, you might be tempted to dismiss the current wave of AI as just another turn in the hype cycle that swept through the industry a few years ago—a cycle that, despite its ambitions, didn’t fundamentally transform the business. But if the blistering pace of adoption we are witnessing today is any measure at all, this moment feels undeniably significant. The day before publication of this article marked 2 years since OpenAI’s commercial debut of ChatGPT. Since then, many of the largest oil companies around the world have moved well beyond the decision to adopt generative AI at enterprise level (many via Microsoft’s ChatGPT-based Copilot) and are now focused on scaling its use at the operational level—where the real value is to be created. There is also a big external driver that has many within the business taking note of AI’s immediate impact. At ADIPEC, leaders of some of the world’s top producers said the expanding uptake of AI across industries is surpassing their expectations and driving upward revisions in future energy demand forecasts. In his opening remarks at the conference, ADNOC Group CEO Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber highlighted the energy demands of AI, noting that a single ChatGPT prompt consumes 10 times more energy than a standard Google search. While acknowledging its transformative potential, he remarked, “The exponential growth of AI is also creating a power surge that no one anticipated 18 months ago.” Others speaking in Abu Dhabi last month cited projections that the capacity of the world’s data centers will double within 6 years, requiring at least 150 GW of new capacity by 2030. From there, demand is expected to double again by 2040. Renewables will play a role in answering the call, as will many new natural gas-fired power plants. Tengku Muhammad Taufik, CEO of Malaysia’s Petronas, addressed the new trajectory of global energy demand because of AI, saying he, along with his executive team, is “slowly waking up to the fact that we may have grossly underestimated the actual gradient within the next 4 or 5 years.” The new forecasts are surprising BP CEO Murray Auchincloss too. Using the US as an example, where AI infrastructure buildout is booming, he said demand showed signs of leveling off during the pandemic years, but “now every month that I review it with the team we see another tick up, another percentage point up in energy demand growth.” The BP chief added that the trend is also evident in India and China and that it will soon be felt in a few other countries. As the host of the annual conference, ADNOC took center stage by sponsoring an AI-themed exhibition hall teeming with many of the latest emerging technologies mentioned above. But the company also used the event to show that it is putting its money where its mouth is when it comes to earning a role as an early adopter of advanced AI. The company announced at ADIPEC a $920-million contract with Middle East engineering firm Jereh Oil and Gas to equip more than 2,000 onshore wells across the UAE with AI-enabled remote controls, a digitization project set to be completed by 2027. ADNOC CEO Al Jaber, who also serves as the UAE minister of industry and advanced technology, confidently told attendees that AI is “one of those era-defining breakthroughs that is changing the pace of change itself.” He shared his belief that AI may soon handle half of the tasks currently performed by the average human while unveiling ADNOC’s plan to become the first oil and gas producer to rely on custom-built agentic AI. This initiative, developed in partnership with software firms AIQ, Microsoft, and G42, aims to merge machine learning models with generative AI. Their aim is to build advanced “agents” capable of working with various programs, including other agents, to perform a wide range of tasks with minimal or no human oversight. “It will not only analyze petabytes of data, but will proactively and autonomously identify operational improvements. It will perceive, think, learn, and act,” Al Jaber said of the program, dubbed ENERGYai. ADNOC plans to begin testing ENERGYai on real-world data before the end of the year. The program’s ambitious targets include reducing seismic survey timelines from months to days, cutting geological model delivery times by 75%, and boosting production forecast accuracy by up to 90%. To get ready for this new paradigm, ADNOC has carried out an expansive training program that has so far taught more than 30,000 employees about the foundational aspects of AI. A smaller group of about 5,000 employees have been tapped to go a step further by receiving specialized training on how best to interact with generative AI platforms, a new human skillset called prompt engineering. Although still in its early stages, one of ADNOC’s generative AI rollouts has already turned some heads within the company by increasing field operator productivity by 20%. Detailed in a paper presented at ADIPEC, SPE 222046 speaks to a generative AI tool that helps field maintenance teams by suggesting how to fix equipment based on manuals, historical events, and real-time data. ADNOC is of course not the only oil and gas company in the region boasting of its embrace of this new breed of AI. In neighboring Saudi Arabia, the national oil company has been developing a generative AI platform called Metabrain AI that it unveiled earlier this year. At ADIPEC, the company revealed that one of the tasks the platform has been successful in is optimizing complex drilling rig movements across the Kingdom. Ashraf Al Tahini, vice president of the upstream digital center at Aramco, said during the conference that generative AI has also been integrated into daily drilling reports as part of this deployment. Across the Gulf, the Kuwait Oil Company has been leveraging its own ChatGPT-like programs to predict and manage production from wells with high water cuts. According to Adel Al-Azmi, manager of the corporate information technology group for the company, this application has been translated into a daily revenue savings of about $400,000. Declaring the value of generative AI to be proven, he explained that water-cut analysis, which once took engineers several days, has become significantly more efficient. “Now we can achieve a decision within minutes on which oil wells to shut down and how to route our production lines,” said Al-Azmi. The Kuwaiti technology executive added that the national oil company has been using generative AI for about a year to analyze well logs, achieving a 90 to 95% improvement in catching inaccurate anomalies in the data as compared with the traditional manual method. Another key participant at ADIPEC, Occidental Petroleum, has launched its own “AI Academy,” a training program accessible to employees across the organization. The Houston-based oil company has recently adopted its first AI policies and established a dedicated AI department, led by a chief of AI. Now, just like geosciences or human resources, AI is firmly embedded in the firm’s organizational structure. Oxy also shared at the conference that part of this drive included forming a task force of handpicked employees who identified 180 potential use cases for generative AI across its business. The wide breadth of applications being explored is, indeed, becoming almost overwhelming. At this year’s ADIPEC, more than a dozen papers—authored by groups from the Middle East, the US, France, Brazil, Pakistan, and Italy—demonstrated the versatility of generative AI across a wide range of upstream applications. They included real-time drilling optimization, oil spill detection, simulation of reservoir- and pore-scale fluid dynamics, supply chain contract analysis, worker training, and seismic data interpretation. Authored by specialists with SLB in France, SPE 221862 outlines the creation of what the firm says is a first-of-its-kind tool that uses generative AI to analyze complex drilling databases but that could also be applied to most wellbore domains. “With minimal to no training, drilling engineers can now extract critical decision-making information within seconds. Tasks that previously required software engineers’ weeks to implement can now be executed instantaneously, allowing for faster and more customized data access for end users,” the authors wrote. One discussion that is certain to continue is how to persuade people to adopt generative AI at the scale envisioned by developers and business leaders. With executives openly acknowledging that AI could take over tasks currently handled by skilled professionals, concerns about job security are understandably front and center. And if you think it’s too early in the cycle to worry about this issue, think again. Paul Madero, senior vice president of production solutions at Baker Hughes, shared insights at ADIPEC from an internal study that initially showed generative AI had great potential, only for the return on investment to come back lower than managers had expected. Upon investigation, a reason for the discrepancy became clear. “There was a hesitancy from the team to say how much productivity was created [using AI] because they wanted to know what’s going to happen” to their roles after the test, Madero explained. Baker Hughes learned from the exercise that it is essential to incentivize employees to use AI while reassuring them that it is meant to assist with routine tasks while enabling them to focus on more-complex challenges. A key takeaway from business leaders in Abu Dhabi—something seldom emphasized 5 to 10 years ago—is that it’s not just organizations, but also rank-and-file employees that risk falling behind if they turn their backs on AI at this stage. Khaled Al Blooshi, ADNOC’s vice president for digital projects and innovation, illustrated this point with a personal anecdote about his children convincing him to pay for a ChatGPT subscription to help with their homework. “I had to help them—I had to be a good father,” he joked, before striking a more serious note. “If the younger generation is taking this for granted as a tool to assist them in their simplest homework tasks, you can imagine that as they join the workforce, they will be demanding that these tools be available.” For those in the workforce who fear AI might replace their jobs, a growing counterargument suggests that some roles—perhaps even their own—could become obsolete or simply seen as too unproductive without AI. As Al Blooshi cautioned, employees in key positions who resist this shift risk being considered “outdated and they are displaced with more-competent engineers who are able to commit to AI.” For Further Reading SPE 221862 Empowering Drilling and Optimization With Generative AI by M.

Southeast Asia: A Colonial Oil Producer Fueling Its 21st Century Industrial Revolution With Gas,https://jpt.spe.org/southeast-asia-a-colonial-oil-producer-fueling-its-21st-century-industrial-revolution-with-gas,"With natural gas destined to replace coal as its fuel of choice, Southeast Asia is unabashedly expanding its oil and gas industry to meet the skyrocketing energy demands of a booming population and unprecedented economic growth. Investments in regional hydrocarbon projects through 2029—particularly those in natural gas production—are forecast to exceed 4% compound annual growth rates with the spotlight on the region’s top two petroleum producers, Indonesia and Malaysia, according to the London-based Energy Council, a global network of senior energy finance executives. Norway’s Rystad Energy predicts that final investment decisions (FIDs) will be made between now and 2028 on $100 billion in new projects in the region, twice the $45 billion in FIDs taken from 2014 to 2023. These will include deepwater projects to develop new discoveries in Indonesia and Malaysia, and projects to create a global hub for carbon capture and storage (CCS) such as the one under study by Malaysian state-owned Petronas and Abu Dhabi’s ADNOC. The Malay Archipelago (also called the East Indies) is the world’s largest island group, and depending on the methodology of the geographer, it encompasses the 17,508 islands of Indonesia—literally the world’s largest country comprised of islands—and the approximately 7,000 islands of the Philippines. Indonesia and the Philippines in turn are among the 11 countries that constitute Southeast Asia after adding in Brunei, Burma (Myanmar), Cambodia, Timor-Leste, Laos, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam—all with widely diverse histories, cultures, and religions. But all with one thing in common: a colonial past forged by adventurers from across Europe who in the 19th century arrived on their shores to extract natural resources to feed the Industrial Revolution at home. In the case of the earliest industrial oil production in Dutch Indonesia and British Malaysia, those adventurers, over multiple generations, added Southeast Asia to the US and Azerbaijan as cornerstones of the modern oil industry while also breaking John D. Rockefeller’s monopoly of the Asian oil trade by building the first tanker to traverse the Suez Canal. Shortly after the turn of the 20th century two of these industrialists, one Dutch and one British, merged their companies to create what is today’s energy supermajor known as Shell. The history of oil production in Indonesia and Malaysia dates back over centuries with tales of a cottage industry of hand-dug wells to comb petroleum seeps for medicine, to waterproof boats, and to light torches and lamps. As the Industrial Revolution dawned, the Russian czar financed the world’s first mechanically drilled oil well in 1846 in Baku using cable-tool percussion drilling to carve out a 21-m-deep (69-ft) exploration well. In 1859, Edwin Drake added steam-engine power to a mechanical drill to produce the US’ first industrial class oil in Titusville, Pennsylvania. Meanwhile in Asia, a 20-year-old tobacco farmer, Aeilko Jans Zijklert, raised money to drill a dry hole in 1884 on the east coast of Indonesia’s second-largest island, Sumatra, after having analyzed oil traces found on the island that contained 62% paraffin (kerosene). A year later, he drilled again and struck oil at the Telaga Said concession near the village of Pangkalan Brandan in North Sumatra. Zijklert’s well, Telaga Tunggal No. 1, was for Asia what Baku was for Russia and Titusville was for the US. A new global industry was taking shape. As Shell chronicles today on its website: “By 1890, Aeilko Jans Zijlker felt confident enough to convert his ‘Provisional Sumatra Petroleum Company’ into something more substantial, and on 16 June the company charter of the ‘Royal Dutch Company for the Working of Petroleum Wells in the Dutch Indies’ was executed in The Hague.” After Zijklert’s death in 1890, Jean Baptiste August Kessler took the reins at Royal Dutch. He established a company base at Pangkalan Brandan and by 1898 opened Indonesia’s first oil shipping port at nearby Pangkalan Susu. Kessler’s greatest contribution, in hindsight though, was to initiate early joint-venture talks with British magnate Marcus Samuel Jr. who owned Shell Transport and Trading Company Ltd. In 1897 Shell Transport and Trading discovered oil in the eastern part of Asia’s largest island of Borneo in East Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo today), and in 1899 Samuel set up a small refinery at Balikpapan. In all, as the 20th century dawned, 18 companies were exploring for, and producing oil, in Indonesia and setting up refineries across the islands of Sumatra, Java, and Borneo (East Kalimantan), according to historical accounts. Note: Borneo is divided politically between Malaysia (the states of Sabah and Sarawak) and Brunei in the north; and Indonesia (Kalimantan) in the south, reflecting the colonial legacy left by Britain and the Netherlands. Java (Dutch Indonesia) is found southeast of Sumatra and south of Borneo. While Royal Dutch dominated production and refining in the region, Shell Transport and Trading controlled oil transport and marketing in Asia through its network of business contacts passed down by Samuel’s father who had traded in ornamental seashells coveted by the Victorians—hence the company name Shell. In 1902 Shell and Royal Dutch, while remaining separate entities, created a joint company to handle shipping and marketing on behalf of both firms, The Shell Transport and Royal Dutch Petroleum Co. Ltd. When after a few years it became apparent that Royal Dutch had the edge in oil production and refining, Samuel proposed a merger. Henri Deterding, at the helm at Royal Dutch Petroleum after Kessler’s death, negotiated a 60% controlling stake for Royal Dutch with Shell Transport and Trading owning the remaining 40%. On 24 February 1907, Royal Dutch Shell was born. Samuel’s first oil trades involved purchasing US kerosene to resell in Japan from Standard Oil Co. and the Asian trading house Jardine Matheson. But when he expanded into selling Russian crude from Baku for the Rothschilds, John D. Rockefeller was not amused. At the time, Rockefeller’s Standard Oil monopolized the Asian oil trade because it was cheaper to ship US paraffin to Asia. The Rothschilds and Nobel Brothers in Baku wanted a piece of this trade and the Rothschilds in particular were determined to challenge Rockefeller. The solution lay in cutting costs by shipping Russian crude from the Black Sea port of Batumi (in today’s Georgia) through the Bosphorus Strait to the Mediterranean and eventually the Suez Canal, a shortcut opened in 1869 that significantly slashed the cost of shipping goods between Europe and Asia. The Rothschilds had enlisted Samuel to obtain access to his contacts in the Far East but because oil tankers had been deemed unsafe for traversing the canal, rounding Africa and the Cape of Good Hope was the only water route. Samuel addressed the issue by hiring a British naval architect, James Fortescue Flannery, to design a safer vessel, the oil tanker Murex which in August 1892 completed its maiden voyage through Suez with 4,000 tons of Russian kerosene bound for Singapore. Russian kerosene could now compete on price with Rockefeller’s US product, prices cratered, and Shell rapidly increased its Asian market share, according to historical sources including Daniel Yergin’s book, The Prize. In 1910, Malaysia entered the club with Indonesia as a significant center for Asian exploration and production when the now merged Royal Dutch Shell drilled Malaysia’s first oil well near the fishing village of Miri in Sarawak on the northwest coast of British-controlled Borneo. Miri No. 1, nicknamed “The Grand Old Lady” and preserved today as a state monument, produced 1,950 barrels of oil in its first year after being drilled to a production depth of 452 ft on Miri’s Canada Hill. However grand she was, The Lady peaked at 83 B/D after reaching a final production depth of 1,096 ft before she was abandoned in October 1972. Over the ensuing decades, Shell claimed the following series of firsts: The International Energy Agency’s (IEA) Southeast Asia Energy Outlook 2022 notes that Southeast Asia’s 3% yearly average rise in energy demand over the past 20 years will continue to 2030, driven by a doubling of the population since 2000 and an average 5% yearly economic growth rate. Fossil fuels are projected to meet three-fourths of this demand—primarily gas to replace coal. As a result, the region is attracting investment—in particular, investment from the UAE—to unlock $100 billion in projects on which final investment decisions (FIDs) are expected to be taken by 2028, according to a recent Rystad Energy report. The number of FIDs expected are twice the $45 billion announced from 2014 to 2023 and focus on developing recent discoveries in Indonesia and Malaysia including deep water and projects to create a global hub for carbon capture and storage (CCS) such as the one being studied by Petronas and ADNOC. Malaysia’s move to develop a CCS hub supports its strategy of compensating for the country’s growing consumption of natural gas and development of new gas and oil fields to offset its overall carbon footprint. This in turn has spurred research into novel methods of converting depleted reservoirs and saline aquifers for CCS use in Malaysia. Also sensitive to its rising emissions levels, Indonesia has announced it will tender five geothermal sites for possible development by 2025. Today, Indonesia is Southeast Asia’s largest oil and gas producer, boasting what data and analytics provider Wood Mackenzie called “a steady 6 Bcf/D in gas production over the past 2 decades to offset falling oil output.” In January, Indonesia’s Upstream Oil and Gas Regulatory Task Force (SKK Migas) announced its intent to bring 15 projects onstream in 2024 at an expected capital cost of $560 million. These new projects are forecast to generate a total of 41,922 BOPD and 324 MMscf/D of gas, including Medco E&P Natuna’s Forel-Bronang project in the South Natuna Block off the Riau Islands with a production capacity of 10,000 BOPD, The Jakarta Post reported. Also on the list is ExxonMobil Cepu’s Banyu Urip Infill Clastic project in Bojonegoro, East Java where ExxonMobil began drilling on 27 April as part of a multiyear plan for five carbonate infill wells and two clastic infill wells, according to the The Indonesian Business Post. This would bring on another 30,000 BOPD in production. In August, Indonesian authorities approved Eni’s plan for integrated development of the ultradeepwater Geng North (North Ganal PSC) and Gehem (Rapak PSC) fields to create the new Northern Hub for production in the Kutei Basin. Set to go onstream in 2027, the Geng North project boasts an estimated 5 Tcf of gas and is an example of the sort of project exceeding 152 m in depth that Indonesia wants to encourage. Authorities also approved Eni’s plan for the Gendalo and Gandang fields (Ganal PSC). Additionally, Indonesian authorities have awarded Eni a 20-year extension of the Ganal and Rapak licenses. In Kalimantan, five deepwater projects are expected to go onstream from 2026 to 2028, according to SKK Migas Undersecretary for Exploitation Wahju Wibowo, whose agency has noted in local media that the country’s investment in oil and gas rose 13% to $13.7 billion in 2023 year-on-year and will reach $17.7 billion in 2024. In September, Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Energy announced it had won a 40% interest in the Central Andaman exploration license offshore Sumatra together with UK-listed Harbour Energy (60% operating interest). At the same time, Mubadala confirmed its completion of the South Andaman drilling campaign, with the appraisal of the Layaran discovery having demonstrated the multi-TCF potential of the Andaman Sea basin. Mubadala also holds a 63% operator interest in the Sebuku PSC with TotalEnergies EP Sebuku and INPEX South Makassar Ltd., each holding a 13.5% interest and PT Dangsanak Banua Sebuku (owned by the Government of South Kalimantan and West Sulawesi) with 10% interest. In Malaysia, Mubadala has a 55% operating interest in Block SK 320, home to the Pegaga Gas Field Development. Petronas Carigali holds a 25% stake and Sarawak Shell Berhad 20%. Indonesia is aiming to boost its oil and gas production to reach targets of 1 million BOPD and 12 Bcf/D of gas by 2030 with 54 potential onshore and offshore oil and gas blocks on offer over 2024–2028 focused on untapped areas such as the South Sumatra Basin. Malaysia has its sights set as well on untapped areas, but its biggest potential largess lies in waters of the South China Sea where overcoming technological obstacles are only a small portion of the challenge. For nearly two centuries, Southeast Asia has been central to global energy politics: from the “Game of Thrones” between Europe’s colonial powers in the 19th and early 20th centuries, to World War II and Japan’s first troop landing in Borneo, to the Cold War standoff in Indochina involving the US, Soviet Union, and China, and now to the high-stakes geopolitical maneuvering by regional and global powers in the South China Sea. In a diplomatic note from China to the Malaysian Embassy in Beijing dated 18 February, China had asked Malaysia to stop all exploration and drilling in the South China Sea, even in Malaysia’s own Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). This would include the Luconia Shoals 100 km offshore of Sarawak (2000 km from China) and arguably part of the Spratly Islands to which China, Taiwan, Malaysia, Brunei, Vietnam, and the Philippines all lay claim. In an opinion piece published by NikkeiAsia in September, Phar Kim Beng, CEO of the Malaysian consultancy Strategic Pan Indo-Pacific Arena, pointed out that “it is clear that Malaysia and China have a serious bone of contention … especially (over) the Kasawari gas development projects that began in 2012 at Luconia Shoals.” The China National Offshore Oil Company (CNOOC) announced in August it had confirmed more than 100 Bcm (3.5 Tcf) of proved gas reserves at the Lingshui 36-1 offshore field southeast of China’s Hainan Island province, making the prospect the world’s first major ultrashallow gas field discovered in ultradeep waters. Beng quoted Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim as telling a news conference during the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok, Russia, in September that Malaysia “will have to operate in our waters and secure economic advantage, including drilling for oil, in our territory.” But far from being fighting words, Beng argued that China’s demand was more about pushing Malaysia to agree a code of conduct on the South China Sea which is currently under discussion within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Territorial disputes are a major reason that the South China Sea remains largely unexplored. What has been discovered is near to shore, amounting to about 3.6 billion bbl of petroleum liquids and 40.3 Tcf of proved and probable reserves of natural gas, according to Rystad Energy data quoted in a US Energy Information Administration (EIA) Regional Analysis Brief in March.

The Evolution of the Land Drilling Rig,https://jpt.spe.org/the-evolution-of-the-land-drilling-rig-restricted,"The earliest land rigs used materials like bamboo and iron and were powered by animals such as horses or oxen. These rigs used percussive drilling to create the bore, repeatedly raising and dropping heavy iron bits—effective but slow. By the time Edwin Drake was drilling the Titusville well in 1859, steam engines had been introduced to help power now metal pipe down into the Earth’s crust. By the 1950s, steam-powered rigs gave way to diesel engines. The 1960s would see the advent of self-elevating rigs—the transition from derricks to mast. During the 1970s, electrical power using on-site generators was introduced to drive systems on the rig, and the advent of new downhole tools would allow drillers to directionally drill while maintaining rotation. In the mid-1980s, the first steerable drilling system was introduced. Soon, the evolution would move from the drill floor and downhole into the doghouse (driller’s cabin). Gone were the mechanical hand brakes and foot pedal systems, replaced by touchscreens and joysticks. The land rig has come a long way. Hoisting capability and rig-up requirements were key drivers in the design of older units rather than an ability to store materials and move. Older rig-floor configurations were modified to accommodate pipe-handling equipment instead of designed to integrate pipe-handling equipment. These units were not driven by location sizes nor multiwell pad capabilities. Most of this would change with the coming of the new millennia, and by 2010, it would seem like new innovations would be integrated into land rig design every year—from larger variable skid systems allowing for pad and batch drilling to app-based automation driving efficiency and safety profile. Most of what drove innovation in land rigs can be traced back to development in the offshore sector. Much of what would become standard technology on land had its roots offshore, starting with one of the most important technology transfers of the 1990s—topdrives. “Most of us came out of offshore, and so we didn’t have preconceived ideas of what a land rig was,” said Chris Major, director—global engineering support at Helmerich & Payne (H&P). “Even before H&P went out and converted aging offshore vessels rigs over to topdrive rigs, I was putting Varco TD‑4s or Maritime Hydraulics DDM 650s on offshore rigs. But offshore topdrives were the standard. In fact, if your offshore rig didn’t have a topdrive, it couldn’t get contracts. Then we started getting into jobs with supermajors internationally, and that became the contractual standard for deep-drilling, international land rigs—the same offshore topdrives on these big land rigs. That got us thinking about the future.” The future had the executives at H&P making some important decisions about the direction of the company. As 2000 approached, word from management was that H&P was going to be a topdrive rig company. Over the next few years, AC topdrives were installed on SCR-style rigs. Before long, the aim was to convert the entire fleet. “People were kicking and screaming,” recalled Major. “A lot of our team didn’t want these. Even operators did not want the things. We tried to negotiate a little bit with them, just to see if we could cover the purchase, and eventually, we managed to convince them. But then, our operations folks didn’t even want the things. They saw high cost, downtime, learning curves, but we had a leadership that was committed to work through those issues and find solutions.” Everybody questioned the move. At NOV, the prevailing thought in the mid-1990s was that there was no way topdrives would make the migration from sea to land because the land rig structures themselves couldn’t take it. “That’s why you saw the big yellow beam up the middle of all the topdrives,” said David Reid, NOV chief technology officer/chief marketing officer. “We had to take all the load and the torque to the base of the rig. Once we worked that out, because the old Bowen unit—it was an in-line, so the mud line comes through the motor—was this very tight package. It wasn’t until we started to think about it, because we were putting them on masts on offshore rigs. Same problem, masts are not good for taking torque. Once it happened, we really didn’t think it was going to be as big a deal as it was. I mean, we did a few once we got the smaller Reliance motors, because we weren’t running through the main gearbox, which was very much the Varco-IDS type design here. These motors are sitting off the back. But once you got smaller‑package induction motors, it really changed everything.” Topdrives brought several efficiencies to land drilling. First, drilling with “stands” became possible. Stands are multiple joints of connected drillpipe which can be added to the drillstring at once, rather than adding a single pipe at a time. Traditionally, drilling crews would need to add one joint (one length of pipe) to the drillstring at a time, which was time-consuming. By connecting two or three pipes into a stand beforehand, the rig could add more pipe to the drillstring in a single operation, increasing drilling speed by reducing the frequency of stopping to add pipe. This advancement enabled the ability to trip back stands and drill using preassembled stands built offline. Additionally, drillers could now back-ream to clear and smooth the borehole. Second was directional drilling—another innovation transfer from offshore. The addition of the topdrive to the land unit made directional drilling possible, which would become increasingly important in the 2000s when the shale boom arrived. It was around that time that the locomotive industry began adopting AC drive technology in diesel-electric locomotives—an application that led to the birth of the AC drilling rig. Creating a drilling rig with a topdrive integrated into an AC drive system and deployed in a scalable fashion became revolutionary for the drilling industry as well. It wasn’t popular at first; however, without it, the industry would be unable to drill today’s modern wells. “I remember being on a plane with our leadership, and my boss at the time was passing around information about some new advances in AC drive technology used on diesel locomotives,” recalled Major. “We started looking at this, and what we were thinking about was the idea of a machine that can have 100% torque and zero speed. Suddenly we were like, ‘Hey, that sounds like a hoist. That sounds like a drawworks.’” Added Reid, “We were about 10 years behind trains. All we were doing when we went to DC, we were just picking up traction motors off the train industry. The original thought was that if they’re getting rid of these old motors, we can bring them in. The old GE 752 was on everything—your drawworks, your rotary table, your topdrive—and the idea was interchangeability. That was the logic that got them into it. The idea that we can buy secondhand, refurbished motors drove the original topdriver, but no one ever thought those would work on land.” When the AC drilling rig was developed, it was the first purpose-built rig for pad drilling. Pad drilling was a solution for a key operational need: the construction of multiple wells from a single location. At that time, single wells would be drilled in a row, but pad drilling has not become prevalent. An H&P rig design was engineered and coupled with manufacturing capabilities that resulted in the construction of hundreds of rigs in a relatively short amount of time. This shift in need for pad drilling combined with the new AC rig design ultimately enabled the US shale revolution. “AC was disruptive,” said Major. “We thought about having real block control, where we have precise control. We weren’t thinking at that time about drilling apps and some of these other things we’ve since been exposed to like FinTech or soft torque on SCR type rigs. We were just thinking about having block control and feedback, precise driller control, and an air-conditioned cabin with touchscreens instead of the old brake handle on the rig floor.” While important to the US shale boom, the initial push behind bringing AC rigs to the market was more about a general rethink about what a modern drilling rig should look like rather than by any specific need or application. H&P would introduce its AC-powered rig design in its Flex3 rig to its FlexRig fleet—a rig no customer was asking the contractor to build. It was more about bringing game-changing technology to the fore rather than satisfying demand. The company took the risk, and the first Flex3 rigs began rolling out of the yard in 2002. “They were very focused on performance, selling better performance,” said Reid. “Everything before that was price. They started to separate out being more expensive and being worth it and then training with crews for safety. They were starting to match where the industry was going. So, after AC, the driller’s cabin turns into an arcade game versus a hand brake. It was really the electronic driller, and once again, H&P drove it.” The FlexRig fleets, including the later Flex4s and Flex5s, were wildly successful for H&P in the years that followed, helping the company to grow from just 3% market share in 2001 to approximately 20% market share in US land by the mid-2010s. Introducing walking rigs to a global fleet has contributed to reducing well-cycle times by over 35% from 2016 to 2022. What was once a 3 to 5-hour release-to-spud skid, is now as low as 1½ hours using walking technology. Connected to the power supply from the backyard and increased rotational freedom ensured most walking rigs would never have to power down while transitioning from well to well. “If you think about it, we were doing wheeled systems early on in Alaska, and it was because you were just trying to drill and move this massive rig structure that was designed to keep us all warm,” said Reid. “We were going to live on these things. They were almost like platforms on land. When you were in cold environments, it was better to walk a rig.” Today’s walking rigs use hydraulic “legs” to move up to 500 ft across a drilling location without the need for additional heavy transportation equipment, eliminating the need to assemble and disassemble certain components. The walking legs can also adapt to different terrains, including uneven surfaces and inclines making it difficult to reach more-accessible areas. Walking packages were developed with several scenarios in mind but were critical in addressing many of the needs of the next generation of unconventional drilling. Walking rigs allowed for wider well-row spacing and placing more rows in a single drilling area. “What was really controlling the distances we could translate had to do with the slope on the flowline and gravity feedback to the mud systems,” explained Major. “So, we started thinking—How do we do walking? How do we use all these tracks? How do we reduce nipple-up times (the duration required to assemble or connect the various components of a drilling rig)? How do we cover most locations? “We were still dealing with existing wellheads and trying to clear them. You have to deal with that. Then the other thing is, you’re on a pad drilling. How do we figure this out as we translate and do pipe-handling over the wells we just were on? Walking it, side-saddling it, and building in wellhead clearances are the most flexible things we can do. Then we started dealing with whether we want to be captive to flowlines. That’s why we started on our versions. We’ve got pump-back systems. We were trying to create a design that could work for nearly any pad drilling location in the US. That’s what drove it,” Major said. Robotics. Artificial intelligence. Autonomous drilling. Much of what the future holds for land drilling centers on the ability of industry to harness and apply new and existing technologies in ways that will once again drive efficiency and safety. There are already robots on rigs that are making pipe connections on Permian Basin wells. In addition to providing consistency and efficiency in drilling tasks, new automated solutions allow for the removal of personnel from red zones on the drill floor. Another area being looked at is sustainability, which could lead to more hybrid-powered units with energy storage capabilities. The evolution will continue as the focus shifts from brawn to brains and from task to process. Today’s well programs are not one-size-fits-all; they take into account a variety of factors, including company size, geographical location, and specific characteristics such as well spacings, fracture spacings, and optimal pad sizes. New considerations are being added all the time. Based on the continuing evolution, the future energy landscape will likely necessitate additional ways to transform the modern land drilling rig into the rig of the future. As operators increase their involvement in the energy transition, drilling capabilities must further evolve to drill geothermal wells and explore additional opportunities.

"Offshore Tech Evolves for Deeper Waters, Deeper Reservoirs",https://jpt.spe.org/offshore-tech-evolves-for-deeper-waters-deeper-reservoirs,"Since the late 1930s, the offshore industry has moved from installing the first offshore platform in 14 ft of water to the ultradeepwater 20K era. Advances in seismic, drilling, and development technologies all helped move the industry from shallow waters to ultradeepwaters, from lower-pressure reservoirs to high-pressure/high-temperature (HP/HT) reservoirs, and beyond known hydrocarbon areas like the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) into frontier regions, like Guyana. Brent Gros, vice president of Chevron’s GOM business unit, told JPT there is a stark difference between the GOM of today and how it was when he first started working in the area 26 years ago. Now, he said, operating further from land in water depths of 4,000 to 7,000 ft is the norm. “We’re not really taking crew boats to those platforms, given the distance from shore. We operate as well at much higher pressures,” he said. Jayme Meier, ExxonMobil’s vice president of deepwater project delivery, echoed that sentiment. At the dawn of the offshore era, “anything that was in any amount of water was, by definition, deep water, because it was as far as you could go,” she told JPT. “And we are now at the stage where we are routinely doing things that are in 2000 m (6,560 ft) of water or more, and we continue to press boundaries and technical limits to be able to move further out in water depth.” As such, she said, the fundamental definition of deep water has shifted in the past quarter century. “To find oil and gas resources, we rely on seismic, and we’ve seen huge advancements in seismic over the past 25 years,” Gros said. 3D seismic technology, pioneered half a century ago, sharpened the view into the world’s reservoirs, and new seismic processing methods have helped identify new opportunities. “Now we have ocean-bottom node surveys, which essentially take a lot of the noise out of surveys, allowing us to image deeper with a clearer image. We also have four-dimensional seismic, which helps us understand the performance of reservoirs through time,” he said. “If you compare the seismic capability today to what we had in the past, it’s like seeing the world with a new pair of glasses, and it really helps us understand potential prospects in a more-complex geological setting and pursue those opportunities in deeper water and deeper horizons than we previously would have been able to.” Moving into ever deeper waters requires more tech and more-capable drilling rigs. It also requires precision, Meier noted. “Technology allows us to position a floating rig on the surface of the ocean. It’s got to be able to drill at very precise angles and precise locations, and significant extensions of technology were needed to enable that to happen. We’re at the point now where we’re even doing multizone completions on our wells in deep water,” she said. She called deepwater “by far the most exciting space” to work in. It requires planning and designing for facilities that must withstand intense, harsh, and constantly changing conditions throughout its lifetime. “You are floating on a surface, and you have to be able to pinpoint exactly where you’re going to land subsea hardware, exactly where you’re going to moor an FPSO and hit target boxes that are a few feet by a few feet, and they’re 6,000 ft below you,” she said. “It is the most exciting thing that I’ve ever been involved in. And it involves technology, technical know-how, and an ability to really plan the base plan and the contingency plan.” The higher-pressure reservoirs the industry is encountering require equipment adequate for the task. Lars Herbst, who retired from the post of Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement’s (BSEE) GOM regional director in late 2021, told JPT that early in his career, much of the equipment was not ready for HP/HT operations. Once equipment rated for 10,000-psi operations was introduced, “it quickly moved to 15,000 psi, and stayed that way until just a few years back, when the 20,000-psi BOP (blowout preventer) equipment and wellheads and things like that were introduced,” he said. “That’s a big improvement on the drilling side.” And Chevron helped hasten the development of 20K capabilities so it could move forward with its Anchor project, which delivered first oil 11 August in the GOM with production flowing to a semisubmsersible moored in 5,000-ft water depth in Green Canyon Block 763. Transocean’s 8th-generation Deepwater Atlas and Deepwater Titan drillships, rated to work in 12,000-ft water depths and drill to 40,000-ft depths, entered operations in 2022 and 2023, respectively. The Atlas, initially rated for 15,000-psi operations but later upgraded for 20,000-psi operations, went under contract to Beacon Offshore Energy for work in the ultra-HP/HT Shenandoah development in the Walker Ridge area of the GOM, and the 20,000-psi-rated Titan started operations on Chevron’s Anchor development. The Titan “can operate with a 3-million-pound hookload. To be able to lift well equipment with thicker wall thickness and heavier weights requires rigs that are more capable,” Gros said. He said trailblazing 20K reservoir activity took fortitude. “Industry previously said, ‘This is something we can’t access,’ and it takes some fortitude to start down the journey of developing the technology,” Gros said. “Just a few years ago, there wasn’t a rig capable of doing this. There wasn’t a BOP. There weren’t regulations to support the development. And so, it takes a lot of work to unlock this, and we’re now poised to really benefit from it.” As the industry ventured out into the GOM, how it approached projects changed dramatically, Gros said. Historically, shelf projects tended to spread out. “There was a lot of infrastructure spread,” he said. “Now that we’re operating in deep water, the infrastructure is much more expensive, and we can’t have a platform near every group of wells, so we tend to rely on longer distance tie backs.” Chevron plans to bring its Ballymore subsea tieback, sanctioned in May 2022, online in 2025, with production from the field in Mississippi Canyon Block 607 in around 6,600 ft flowing through a 3-mile tieback to the Blind Faith production semisubmsersible in Mississippi Canyon Block 650. “We have ample infrastructure as an industry in the Gulf of Mexico, and so how we leverage other opportunities to fill that infrastructure is going to be a key part of being efficient,” Gros said. Chevron is drilling three wells into the Norphlet formations, with the wells expected to produce up to 75,000 BOPD to the Blind Faith production facility. And while the Ballymore tieback is relatively close, the industry can step out much further, made possible through improvements in tech such as subsea boosters and pumps and communication capabilities. “It’s like its own little ecosystem, the subsea development,” Gros said. “You can’t even see the next facility, and everything is below the sea.” There have also been advances in control systems that enable chemical injection from a distance, he noted. Herbst, too, gave the nod to control systems as an enabler. SCADA technology’s ability has improved to control systems “much better than they could even 25 years ago,” he said. On the production side, he said, overall improvement in electronics has made a major difference, as has the move from all-hydraulic systems to electro-hydraulic or all-electric. “That was absolutely necessary for the subsea development to really occur,” Herbst said. Sensors and transmitters, too, have improved. “Moving into deep water really could not have occurred without the advancement in that technology,” he said. “I think there’s still quite a bit of room for advancement in that area, digitalization of a lot of the processes and measurements.” None of the deepwater projects would be possible, though, without subsea hardware. “Just the idea that you build something once, you put it down on the ocean floor, and it’s going to function—a tree, a manifold, a valve, an umbilical, a subsea processing kit—for the life of an asset, or very close to that, is pretty phenomenal,” Meier said. “Those are very carefully designed things that have become more robust over time.” However, she said, there is room for improvement when it comes to subsea processing and compression. “I think advances are needed in subsea processing. More subsea hardware to do more work on the subsea floor and less on top,” Meier said. One of the larger offshore frontier regions to open up in the past 25 years is Guyana, where ExxonMobil has three FPSOs in production, three FPSO-based projects underway, and several more projects in early development. “There’s a whole long story behind how we found it. It was touch and go for a while, but after we found it, we were able to deliver our first FPSO within 5 years from discovery to startup,” Meier said. And while the supermajor has a series of FPSOs planned for its Stabroek block offshore Guyana, they’re not cookie-cutter replicas. “We’re working in a mindset that says we’re going to use the best we have available today, and then we’re going to learn as we go,” she said. The objective is that as soon as the project team learns something, it determines how to best apply that knowledge to the next project, so each project continues to get better. “You should not make the same mistake twice. You can learn from it once you apply those learnings, and then you move forward,” Meier said. For example, she said, the first FPSOs deployed offshore Guyana used industry-available technology to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. For the fourth unit, ExxonMobil was able to incorporate waste-heat recovery units into the compact FPSO layout for the Yellowtail field. For the Uaru field FPSO, ExxonMobil added combined-cycle technology, which uses steam-turbine generators to improve thermal efficiency and reduce GHG emissions. It will be only the second application of the technology, Meier said, and it is a complicated addition because of the interdependencies of power generation and processing. Rather than repeating that on the next FPSO, ExxonMobil sought out a different approach. “We challenged ourselves on the sixth one and said, ‘Okay, what else can we do to get to that same GHG footprint?’ What technical solutions can we either adopt, adapt, or make ourselves to get to the same output?” she said. Instead of using combined-cycle technology to get to the desired GHG level, the operator adopted a number of other technologies for the Whiptail field FPSO, she said. A deepsea water intake hose pulls deeper and colder water from the sea to help with cooling at the surface thereby reducing pump and compressor duty. ExxonMobil also opted to step down the arrival pressure of the fluids at the FPSO to reduce wall‑pipe thickness and compression requirements. By combining different technologies, she said, it was possible to achieve the same outcome without using the complex combined-cycle approach. “We’re seeing an evolution,” she said. And pulling together each of these FPSO projects is a study in choreography. “We have stuff in 26 countries that is coming together into this final campaign for each project, where every single thing has to come together at that one site,” Meier said. “This is a place where technology capability, project management, and wells, execution, performance all have to come together.” One of the biggest concerns about working in deep water is doing so safely. On 20 April 2010, Transocean’s Deepwater Horizon rig exploded while drilling BP’s Macondo prospect in the GOM, killing 11 and leading to the largest marine oil spill in the industry’s history. “It was always thought that with the Deepwater Horizon, there was a large company involved there, and they had the competency and the depth within their company to respond to it,” Herbst said. “If that was a smaller company, you know, not really sure how that response would have gone.” Herbst called the explosion a black swan incident. There was “a very low probability of something like that happening, but the consequences, obviously, were so high,” he said. “It’s always thought the BOP stack could handle it, could shut it in through various means of shut-in even after evacuation of the rig.” The well released about 4 million bbl of oil over the course of 87 days until it was finally shut in. The Macondo explosion led to a series of safety measures, including the requirement for an operator to be able to cap a well if there’s a blowout. “Advancements in well capping for wells that do blow out, the well capping, and all the equipment associated with that was critical to get back to drilling in deep water again,” Herbst said. The Marine Well Containment Company (MWCC) and HWCG LLC developed capping stacks that could be rapidly deployed in the event of another deepwater blowout. The industry, Herbst said, now has a solution that allows drilling with the confidence “that if there was a recurrence of an incident like that, it would not go on for 87 days.” Over the years, BSEE has carried out unannounced drills to test how companies respond in the face of an incident. Herbst added that these drills resulted in capping stacks being transported and installed in less than 10 days. Gros said Chevron did extensive testing to ensure the capping tech could function in 20,000‑psi conditions, and, separately, BSEE conducted an unannounced drill in May 2023 to test Chevron, the industry, and MWCC’s capability to respond to a deepwater well blowout. Chevron is one of 10 operators that comprise MWCC. “We actually did a 5-day exercise. Chevron led a team where we deployed and installed a capping stack in 6,200 feet of water,” he said. “It was a simulated event, but it was our regulators wanting to ensure the capability of the industry to respond.” During the drill, a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) closed 10 valves to shut in a simulated well. “BSEE said at the conclusion that it was just a remarkable achievement. It’s a milestone for containment response,” Gros said. He said response is one layer of keeping things safe, but things like safety systems are preventative. “When a piece of equipment failed, we would learn about it as it had the problem,” he said. Now, sensors are alerting the industry to potential trouble. “We have sensors that start to predict, ‘Hey, this is trending.’ Maybe temperatures are starting to rise, or vibration is starting to increase, so we can start to plan our maintenance better,” he said. “Cars do the same thing. You now get a low-air-pressure warning. You don’t feel the flat tire, you get a little warning that says, ‘Hey, your tire’s starting to lose some pressure.’” Gros expects the industry to continue innovating ways that sensors can help improve safety, such as leveraging camera technology to help prevent people from being in the way of heavy lifts. Herbst said BOP health monitoring systems, which look at the time to failure on BOP equipment and systems, have advanced. “That actually led to BSEE being able to move to a 21-day BOP test cycle, which a lot of the world had already moved to without the advancement in technology,” he said. Automation, such as pipe-handling systems, has also helped make the industry safer, Herbst said. “The rig-floor automation, the pipe-handling systems have advanced quite a bit,” he said. “There were learning curves with all of this technology that’s introduced, but I think ultimately that’s made the rig floor a safer place to work for those on the drilling crew.” Looking forward, Herbst said he expects technology to continue to evolve and enable offshore operations. “Technology is great, but there’s always a concern over serial No. 1 technology coming out and ensuring that the safety is not compromised,” he said. Artificial intelligence (AI) will likely play a role going forward, he added. Herbst also urged companies not to let the industry’s up and down cycles affect research efforts. “The up and down cycles of oil and gas are not very helpful toward advancing safety,” he said. “I always see research drop off when there’s more of a bust cycle going on. But I think that research is key to keeping up with advancements in safety.” Gros said he believes the GOM in 25 years will look different from today, especially if one considers history to be a guide. “A decade ago, people thought 20,000 psi wasn’t possible, and just this year, we’ve completed the world’s first 20,000‑psi subsea well that will unlock new opportunities,” he said. “There’s lots of prospects that rely on that technology, and we’ve unlocked the first in the world.” Subsea tiebacks will get longer, he said, and companies will increase their reliance on AI-based technology as the industry continues to focus on efficiency. “I think you’ll see the role of data, the role of technology, and AI helping us figure out the next iteration for the Gulf of Mexico,” Gros said. Meier said she expects future developments to require fewer people, which would change how facilities are created. People offshore require rescue crafts, blast walls, and other equipment intended to save lives. While fully unmanned facilities are a stretch, she said the company has been working with contractors on ways to minimize the number of offshore personnel required for facilities. “Are there bite-sized pieces you could take off that would help prove out the concept?” she asked. “If you could do something that had less need for people to manage it day to day and more remote operations, that would be a significant benefit in terms of what you design and how you operate it, and the cost structure for both.” Meier said the expansion of the industry into frontier basins is exciting. “While we know where the basins are in the world today, if you were able to go even deeper, where would those next basins be? Because if we think ahead to the next 25 or maybe 50 years, it may be that we’re in waters our current technology won’t let us be in today,” she said.

,https://jpt.spe.org/the-kurdistan-region-of-iraq-a-decade-of-challenges-and-increased-oil-and-gas-production,"The Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI), localized in the north and northeast of Iraq, is an autonomous territory recognized in the Iraqi constitution of 2005. Its capital and most populated city, Erbil, is also one of oldest inhabited cities in the world, dated back to around 6000 BC. The KRI’s Parliament was established in Erbil in 1970. In a highly mountainous setting, the KRI hosts colorful biodiversity and a wide range of climate and fertile lands suitable for varied agriculture. Geologically, the Zagros fold and thrust belt, to the north and northeast of the Region, is the most relevant feature. Originating from the collision between the Arabic and Eurasian plates, it gives the subsurface unique structural complexity. The first exploration well in the KRI dates back to 1901, drilled in Chia Surkh in the south of the territory. The well encountered oil shows but was abandoned. Later in 1927, the discovery of Baba Gurgur near Kirkuk was what really ignited the production of oil in northern Iraq. This field, controlled by the Federal Government of Iraq and operated by the Iraq Petroleum Company at that time, was brought onto production in 1934. Over 25 years later, in 1960, the first well was drilled at the Taq Taq field, and the discovery of oil was declared in 1978 following the drilling of a second exploration well. Nonetheless, this field was not appraised until the 1990s. In 2003, the end of the Iraq War triggered the interest of international oil companies (IOCs), which started to arrive in the KRI. In 2005, DNO spudded Tawke-1 in its Tawke license, marking the commencement of the current era in the KRI’s oil industry. The Tawke field started production in 2007, while the previously appraised Taq Taq field started producing in 2008. The Khurmala Dome field, part of the Kirkuk’s complex, was taken over by KAR in 2004 with a remit to revive production and increase it to the 100,000 BOPD mark. As a result, Tawke, Taq Taq, and Khurmala Dome became the three dominant fields in the KRI’s oil production at that time. When it comes to gas, the Khor Mor field started production in newly built facilities in 2008. This initial period of exploration, appraisal, and development in the KRI, up to 2014, has been extensively covered in a work published by David Mackertich and Adnan Samarraiin April 2015. During this time, more than 20 IOCs entered the region, and about 200 wells were drilled. By the end of 2013 the average daily production was 215,000 BOPD, mostly from the three main fields previously mentioned. Over the past decade, production has increased, coming from a larger number of fields compared to the period before 2014. While some operators started or increased oil production in their fields, other fields reached a peak and started to decline. The first expansion of the Khor Mor gas plant in 2018 allowed for more gas production, and some operators started evaluating and implementing gas capture and utilization projects. Moreover, the more intense drilling and production activity enabled a deeper understanding of the region’s fractured carbonate reservoirs and a learning process on how to develop them more effectively. Regional and global events have resulted in cycles of production and fluctuations in activity level. Key among those events were the Kurdistan Regional Government’s (KRG) takeover and successive loss of control of the fields in the Kirkuk disputed area, the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021, and the closure of the Iraq-Turkey export pipeline (ITP) in 2023. At the time of writing, the latter has not yet reopened. This article uses available production data to analyze the performance of key fields and comments on the different factors that have impacted either individual fields or the overall production and activity in the region. By collecting, integrating, and correlating data from diverse sources, the authors aim to provide a solid overview on the main challenges and production achievements of the oil and gas industry in the KRI during the period from 2014 to 2023, enabling a broader comprehension of its evolution, current situation, and future opportunities. In March 2023, Turkey halted the transportation and loading of both Kurdish and Iraqi oil into the ITP, thus stopping the flow of more than 430,000 BOPD from the KRI to be exported to international markets. This decision came after a ruling by the International Chamber of Commerce on an arbitration that had been started by the Federal Government of Iraq in 2014. This closing of the pipeline marked a break in a decade characterized by intensive field development which led to production from a larger number of fields, as well as the decline of some of the earliest big producers. In the 2014–2023 period, fields continued to be appraised while development and production were ongoing, something that is commonly observed in the KRI. Some new field development plans were prepared, including for fields such as Sarsang, Khor Mor, Chemchemal, Kurdamir, Baeshiqa, and Sarta, while some existing fields such as Shaikan had updates to their original plans submitted. Fig. 1 shows a map of the region, including production from key fields for 2 representative years to give a snapshot of the changes that occurred in this period. To understand the full picture of the evolution of hydrocarbon production in the KRI over the past decade, the evaluation needs to consider the geopolitical and global events that took place, in addition to the technical aspects related to the different fields. Fig. 2 displays the total production from 2014 to 2023 matched with relevant events. As a result of the Islamic State group’s presence in Iraq in 2014, the KRG took control of the Kirkuk and Bai Hassan fields in the Kirkuk disputed area that had until then been operated by the Federal Government of Iraq’s North Oil Company. This was the main factor contributing to the increase of production in the region to 577,000 BOPD in 2015, from 312,000 in 2014. Combined production for Kirkuk’s Avana Dome and Bai Hassan fields was estimated to be 230,000 BOPD by 2016. The second most-relevant contributor to this significant production increase by the end of 2015 was an incremental 44,000 BOPD from the Tawke field, which came as a result of a continued, successful drilling campaign involving high-angle and horizontal wells. This campaign started in 2012 with the drilling of Tawke-20, which penetrated 600 m of reservoir section. Initial results were shared by mid-2013, indicating a record rate for this well of 25,000 BOPD, compared to 10,000 BOPD for the best existing vertical producer. Tawke-20 was followed by nine other horizontals in the field, drilled up until the first months of 2015. The production from Taq Taq and Shaikan was also increased from 2014 to 2015, contributing over 13,000 BOPD each to the uplift in the region at that time. 2015 marked the peak of oil production in the KRI. The average daily rate stood above the 500,000 BOPD mark between 2015 and 2017. The Tawke field sustained a production level above 100,000 BOPD during this 3-year period, making it the best-producing field after the Kirkuk fields up until 2020, even though it was by then in decline. Pushing production down from 2015 onward was the pronounced decline of the flagship Taq Taq field, which had been one of the largest producers in 2014. An increase in water production coincided with an oil production drop from 116,000 BOPD in 2015 to 18,000 in 2017. Genel Energy, a partner in the joint-venture operating company TTOPCO, attributed this to an original overestimate in the porosity of one of the main reservoirs. Regardless of the causes, this highlights the difficulties of predicting future performance in the structurally complicated fractured carbonate reservoirs present in the KRI. In early 2017, following the drilling of the Peshkabir-2 well, an oil discovery was announcedin the Peshkabir field, which is part of the Tawke production-sharing contract. The field was put into production and quickly ramped up to over 25,000 BOPD average in 2018. On the other hand, later in 2017, after the KRI’s independence referendum, the Federal Government of Iraq retook the control and operation of Kirkuk’s Avana Dome and Bai Hassan fields. This brought the KRI’s production down to 380,000 BOPD average in 2018, from more than 550,000 the previous year. The KRI retained control over Kirkuk’s Khurmala Dome field, which remains the highest-producing field in the region up to present. In 2019, the KRI’s average oil production rose to 468,000 BOPD, which is 70,000 more than in 2018. The Tawke license contributed 37,000 of that increment, of which 9,600 incremental came from the Tawke Field and 27,400 incremental from the Peshkabir Field, in its third year onstream. From 2019 to 2022, production for the region experienced a slight year-to year decline, going from 468,000 BOPD in 2019 to 434,000 in 2022. The COVID-19 outbreak in 2020 temporarily impacted the drilling of some new wells and other activities, with a recovery observed in 2021. The Tawke field continued with a controlled decline throughout this period, averaging 47,000 BOPD in 2021. Meanwhile, for the younger Peshkabir field, DNO increased production to 62,000 BOPD in 2021 from 53,000 in 2020. The Atrush field also belongs to the small group of fields that has surpassed a yearly production of 40,000 BOPD at some point in its lifetime. This landmark was achieved in 2020, when the closing annual average production was slightly over 45,000 BOPD, an increase from 32,000 in 2019. After 2021, the production level slipped below 40,000. One new producer was brought online in February 2023, while a second producer was drilled and put on hold awaiting the resumption of export through the ITP. Neighboring Atrush to the north, the Sarsang Block containing the Swara Tika field (along with the more recently developed East Swara Tika) represents a case of continuous growth since the start of production in 2014, closing 2022 with an average production of 33,200 BOPD from 7 wells between both fields. Following the commissioning of a new 25,000-BOPD facility in Q3 2022, the operator had plans to take the average production above 50,000 BOPD in 2023 before international exports were interrupted. In the southern part of the KRI, the operator of the Sarqala field reported production peaks of 35,000 BOPD and 33,000 during 2019 and 2021, respectively. Data covering a longer period and up to present is not readily available. Following the previously mentioned ITP closure at the end of Q1 2023, IOCs had to stop production immediately, having minimal or no storage capacity. However, over the course of the following months, they negotiated agreements to sell the oil locally, albeit at prices heavily discounted, somewhat mitigated by receiving upfront payments for their production. As of May 2024, production in the region is estimated to have recovered to a level of 300,000 BOPD from an average of 408,000 in Q1 2023 before the ITP closure occurred. Fig. 3 shows a comparative bar chart for seven key oil-producing fields between 2014 and 2022. It should be noted that: 1) accurate production information and breakdown for the Khurmala Dome field is difficult to obtain and therefore it has been estimated, and 2) the year 2023 is excluded from the plot as it is affected by the ITP closure. While Khurmala Dome continues to be the largest producing field, the overall picture for the remainder of oil production has changed. The chart shows that until 2017 there were fewer fields with each contributing larger volumes. More recently, there has been a larger number of fields, both mature declining and younger ramping up, each delivering smaller but more sustained volumes over time. One interpretation of this trend is that the larger accumulations of oil have been discovered and produced (to a certain extent) and that any new fields will be smaller. This would fit with the “creaming curve” hypothesis for how basins are explored and developed. An alternative interpretation is that operators are more cautious in how quickly they invest capital, given the technical, operational and commercial challenges of operating in the region. These are not mutually exclusive. Gas reserves in the KRI are estimated to be in the range of 25 Tcf which would represent 0.35% of the worldwide gas reserves. Nonetheless, gas production and utilization projects in the KRI are still in relatively early, evolving stages. Gas production currently comes from two fields: Khor Mor (nonassociated gas) and Khurmala Dome (associated gas). The Khor Mor gas field, operated by the Pearl Consortium and accounting for 90% of gas provision in the region, started production in August 2008. Fig. 4 shows Khor Mor production performance in the decade from 2014 to 2023. During the initial 5 years of this period, production was nearly constant at 300 MMscf/D. Following arbitration on a contractual dispute between Pearl and the KRG, in 2018 there was an agreement between the parties to increase production. By 2021 production had increased to above 450 MMscf/D. A further expansion of 250 MMscf/D (known as the “KM250 project”) is currently being executed. However in April this year, Khor Mor suffered a significant drone attack, causing four casualties and the suspension of activities for several days. By May 2024 gas production had resumed, with the operator stating that daily production was exceeding 500 MMscf/D of gas, 1,100 metric tons of LPG, and 15,000 B/D of condensate. Further development of the significant gas resources in the KRI will require an export pipeline. Various schemes have been proposed over the past 10 years, but none have made it into execution. Much of the gas in the KRI contains significant proportions of H2S which needs to be removed before export and therefore increases the cost of upstream and midstream processing facilities. Gas from Khor Mor does not have this property, which is one of the reasons why it was developed first. Nevertheless, development of gas resources with high H2S content is feasible and has been done in other parts of the world, e.g., Kashagan (in construction), Tengiz, and Karachaganak fields in Kazakhstan. The same will be possible in the KRI with suitable commercial agreements for the whole value chain. The experience of the past decade has led most operators to pursue a development and production strategy that can be characterized as “learn as you go” where appraisal is ongoing through a phased development. A consequence of this “appraise while developing/producing” philosophy is that fields can be brought onto production more quickly, but production will increase relatively slowly as future phases need to be justified for development. This strategy is at least partly a consequence of the complicated, highly folded, faulted and fractured geology in the region. This makes the subsurface data difficult to interpret and the reservoirs more challenging to model in conventional ways. Understanding of reservoir structure and performance only comes once there is significant production history. Negotiations to reopen the ITP and to resolve new contractual terms for IOCs will play a key role in dictating both oil production and activity levels in the years to come. The potential for decarbonization of oil production together with further gas production and sales remains unaltered. Political and regulatory stability is needed for these goals to materialize.

,https://jpt.spe.org/azerbaijan-the-land-of-unquenchable-fire,"For millennia, Zoroastrian fire worshippers traveled on pilgrimage to pray at temples built where methane seeping from deep underground caused flames to burst from the earth on the Absheron Peninsula near Baku, the capital of today’s Azerbaijan. The Venetian merchant Marco Polo observed such mysterious fires and puddles of oil that bubbled or even gushed as fountains to the surface as he trekked along the Silk Road through the Caucasus Mountains in the 13th century. In a travelogue written in 1298, The Travels of Marco Polo, he is said to have described: “Near the Georgian border there is a spring from which gushes a stream of oil in such abundance that a hundred ships may load here at once. This oil is not good to eat, but it is good for burning and as a salve for men and camels affected with itch or scab.” He was referring to the Khanates of Azerbaijan, a part of the Persian Empire in Marco Polo’s time but absorbed in 1806 into the Russian Empire whose czars took an interest in financing early oil production—hand dug and exported on camel back. Its high paraffin content was valued for producing kerosene lamp oil and lubricants including cannon grease. As the Industrial Revolution swept from West to East in the mid-19th century, many of the innovations and business systems around which the modern oil and gas industry were soon to coalesce were tested in the ancient “Land of Fire.” Czar Nicholas I (1825–1855) financed the world’s first mechanically drilled oil well in 1846 using a cable-tool percussion drilling method. A 21-m-deep (69 ft) exploration well was the result. This happened a decade before Edwin Drake added steam-engine power to a mechanical drill to put Titusville, Pennsylvania, on the map in 1859, as described in the Branobel History archives. By 1871, with Nicholas’ son, the reformer Alexander II now on the Russian throne, boreholes had replaced buckets across the Bibi-Heybat and Balakhani oil fields. The arrival from Sweden in the 1870s of Alfred Nobel’s brothers, Ludvig and Robert, brought a step change to Azerbaijan in terms of industrial innovation, construction, and logistics such that by 1900 Azerbaijan was producing 50% of the world’s oil, historical sources agree. Alexander II had abolished the state monopoly on oil production in 1869, opening the door to foreign industrialists and their capital. Robert Nobel obliged and opened the joint stock Branobel Co. in 1878 with a partner from a weapons plant in the Russian town of Izhevsk. He put down share capital of 3 million rubles ($30,000 in today’s money) to register Tovarishestvo Neftyanogo Proizvodstva Bratyev Nobel—in English, The Brothers Nobel Paraffin Production Company (aka Branobel). The transformation of Baku’s oil fields into a capitalist production sector had begun in 1872 with the auction of 15 blocks in the Balakhani oil field and two blocks in Bibi-Heybat, according to a history prepared by Azerbaijan’s Ministry of Energy in 2020. This drove a 340% growth in oil production between 1876 and 1882, from 24,000 to 816,000 tons, respectively, between those years. By 1894 Azerbaijan’s production equaled that of the US (5.55 million tons per year) though Baku’s fields were 20 times less productive, according to Branobel archivists. Other Branobel firsts as recounted in the company archive include: As the story goes, a Swedish employee of the Nobel Company in Russia had seen an early version of Rudolf Diesel’s invention at an annual meeting of German engineers in the late 1890s. Back home in St. Petersburg, the employee, Anton Carlsund, suggested that Emanuel Nobel acquire the patent. Nobel ran Branobel after his father Ludvig Nobel died in 1888. German experts had contested Diesel’s patent, asking if engines could be run at the high pressure envisioned. As Nobel and Diesel negotiated, a suggestion was made to experiment with heavy oils—likely made by Nobel when he realized the implications for his St. Petersburg factory and the heavy oil produced in Baku. Quoting from the Branobel archive: “On February 16, 1898, Emanuel Nobel signed the contract with Diesel, paying 800,000 Marks. “The cool Swede is now more on fire than me for my engine,” Rudolf Diesel wrote to his wife. Of the 800,000 Marks, 600,000 was paid in cash and 200,000 Marks for shares in the newly established Russische Dieselmotor Co., Nürnberg. This first engine was a 20-hp vertical engine with an A-shaped stand and with a crosshead connection to the connection rod and crank shaft. The machine was tested officially at the Technical Institute in St. Petersburg. During this period of heavy industrialization, the Nobel brothers were hardly alone. The Rothschild’s Banking House in Paris had registered the Caspian Black Sea Co. in 1883 focused mainly on exporting Azerbaijan’s oil and oil products. The family’s banking structures loaned money to build the Transcaucasus Railway linking Baku with the Georgian Black Sea port of Batumi in 1883. They also financed construction of oil tank wagons. As a result, the Rothschilds became the leading exporter of Russian kerosene by the end of the 1880s, Mir-Yusif Mir-Babayev, a professor at Azerbaijan Technical University in Baku, wrote in the spring 2018 edition of Visions of Azerbaijan magazine. Their petroleum concession in Baku was so large that it quickly became the chief competitor of John D. Rockefeller’s company, Standard Oil, before they sold out their oil interests in 1912, according to the Rothschild family archive. The nascent Royal Dutch Shell and Shell Transport and Trading companies cooperated with the Rothschilds and Nobels to further expand Russian crude and kerosene exports from the Absheron Peninsula, particularly to Asia, and further cut into Standard Oil’s monopoly. The growth Azerbaijan’s oil industry experienced in the 19th century, war and ideology destroyed in the early 20th. Between the disruptions of World War I, the Russian Revolution, and civil war across the empire, Azerbaijan’s contribution to world production had by 1920 fallen to 15% while during the same period, US production was in first place globally. The nascent Soviet Union needed help and so as Lenin unveiled his New Economic Policy (NEP), the virtues of profit were written into the Marxist vernacular and oil concessions were offered to foreign companies to draw investment, foreign workers, and the latest technologies to Baku. One deal the Soviets struck in 1923 was with the International Barnsdall Corp., a US-based engineering firm, which brought “dozens of American engineers and technicians” to Baku while “introducing new technologies such as rotary drills necessary for the drilling of larger and deeper wells,” Jonathan H. Sicotte wrote in his dissertation. A review of academic research on the NEP era concludes that the Barnsdall deal was less of a concession and more of a foreshadowing of Soviet trade practices to barter oil for western technology and training while retaining control of the assets. Royal Dutch Shell, whose assets in Baku had been nationalized, and Sinclair Oil negotiated for what would have been true oil concessions and near monopoly control of production. The Soviets said “no.” Eventually Stalin would take the “go it alone” approach to building the USSR’s oil and gas industry in isolation. And so it went until the Soviet Union itself collapsed at the end of 1991. Azerbaijan had declared its independence 4 months earlier in August 1991 after the failed coup in Moscow. It then endured its own political chaos, social upheaval, and a war with Armenia until Heydar Aliyev, a veteran of the KGB and the Soviet Politburo, took control in 1993 in a military coup of Azerbaijan’s own. After centuries of having served the interests of three empires in succession—Persian, Russian, and Soviet—Azerbaijan was finally free to leverage its oil and gas largesse to its own benefit. As the Cold War ended, Baku pivoted to Turkey and set its sights west to Europe. Among the many firsts that Azerbaijan’s oil industry can claim, the one that most shaped the country’s future, not to mention the future of the global oil industry itself, was the discovery in 1949 of the Neft Dashlari (Azerbaijani for Oil Rocks) oil field. An article in the September 2022 issue of the AAPG Explorer noted that at the time of its discovery, “Oil Rocks was considered the world’s largest offshore oil field, both in terms of reservoir volume and recoverable oil reserves.” The Soviets designed special marine vessels to produce in open water up to 100 km offshore and built over the years from 1947 to 1949 Oil Rocks City—the world’s first offshore oil platform seated on wooden piles driven into the seabed, and decommissioned ships that were sunk to create artificial islands (another first in the industry). Still producing, Oil Rocks supplies 70% of Azerbaijan’s domestic oil and gas demand, according to SOCAR. The historic Neft Dashlari complex is being joined to a new gas-processing platform fed by a subsea well in 500-km-deep water as part of today’s Absheron gas and gas condensate offshore project in which TotalEnergies and SOCAR each hold 35% stakes after ADNOC’s 30% farm-in a year ago. The Soviet Union employed directional drilling at Neft Dashlari first before its use spread throughout the Caspian and to west Siberia. “Baku oilmen accelerated the process of development of the offshore fields by applying scientifically based schemes of artificial methods of maintaining (reservoir) pressure by flooding and other techniques,” SOCAR’s Vice President for Geology, Geophysics and Oil and Gas Field Development, Khoshbakht Yusifzade, wrote in Azerbaijan International’s Summer 1996 issue. In a way, the Oil Rocks discovery wasn’t a surprise considering that first oil had technically flowed there 150 years earlier, but the technology needed to sustain production, let alone commercialize it, would take several generations to mature. In 1803, a Baku merchant, Haji Kasimbey Mansurbekov, produced oil from what is said to have been the world’s first offshore wells—two wells dug 18 m (59 ft) and 30 m (98 ft) from the coast in the bay off Bibi-Heybat village. In 1825 a storm destroyed the wells, and the merchant abandoned the project. As of 1859, scientists had begun to study the area, curious about the black oily film that covered rocks in the shallows offshore Baku. In 1896 mining engineer and early pioneer in offshore oil production, Witold Zglenitsky, asked the Baku Mining Department to drill on land reclaimed in Bibi-Heybat Bay. The Mining Department refused Zglenitsky’s project, however. His concept envisioned building a waterproof platform 4 m above sea level to enable oil to load into 200,000-ton (1.4 million‑bbl)-capacity barges in case of a gusher, the AAPG Explorer article detailed. A land reclamation project followed in 1924 in hope of producing the field around Bibi‑Heybat Bay, and a decade later, mining engineer F. Rustambekov proposed methods to develop the Azerbaijan shelf at six potential exploration sites. The dissolution of the USSR freed Azerbaijan of its colonial chains, giving it free reign to leverage its oil and gas wealth to its own benefit. The most consequential event for post-Soviet Azerbaijan was the signing in September 1994 of the “Contract of the Century” which brought on a feeding frenzy among energy majors eager to pay hefty signing bonuses to obtain production sharing agreements (PSAs) to explore and hopefully produce any of a host of blocks that were put on auction at the time. A consortium of 11 foreign oil companies from six countries together with SOCAR signed the PSA to develop the Azeri, Chirag, and Deepwater Gunashli oil fields (ACG): the US, UK, Russia, Norway, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia, plus a “who’s who” of global majors: BP, Amoco, Exxon, Unocal, Statoil, and Lukoil. Most of the other PSAs signed at this time failed as exploration drillers hit only dry holes or identified reserves that were insufficient or too complex to be declared commercial. But ACG prospered, developed by the BP-led Azerbaijan International Operating Company (AIOC). Production peaked at 835,100 B/D in 2010, as described in OTC 25870 which details how engineers addressed geohazards unique to the area while planning the project’s development through 2015. In the first decade after contract signing, AIOC upgraded an existing platform, installed seven new fixed platforms and three subsea well manifolds, laid approximately 1200 km of subsea in-field and pipelines to the Sangachal export terminal onshore, while drilling more than 160 appraisal and production wells, the paper’s authors noted. In April 2024, BP as operator, produced first oil from its $6-billion Azeri Central East (ACE) facility as the nearly 30-year-old ACG development entered a new phase. ACE is historic in that it represents ACG’s first new production since the 2014 startup of the West Chirag platform, but most significantly, the ACE production facility is the first BP-operated offshore platform controlled from onshore, in this case, from the Sangachal export terminal. Oil production is down at ACG with average daily oil production having fallen to 363,000 B/D in 2023 from 415,400 in 2022. Bakhtiyar Aslanbayli, BP vice president for the Caspian region, communications and external affairs, told Russia’s Interfax news service in February that SOCAR is addressing the decline issue. In an interview in March with the German website Caucasus Watch, John Roberts, a nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Global Energy Center, suggested that while “the output of BP’s ACG is half of what it used to be,” gas exports could fill “some of this vacuum” because “condensate can be fed into oil pipelines to export as oil.” We turn now to the high-pressure Shah Deniz gas condensate field, BP’s largest-ever gas find, operated from two platforms in the Caspian Sea under a PSA signed in June 1996 that has since been extended to 2048. BP holds an operating interest of 29.99% in Shah Deniz with partners including Turkey’s TPAO (19.0%), the Southern Gas Corridor (SGC) (21.02%), Russia’s LUKOIL (19.99%), and the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) (10.0%). The start of first gas from Shah Deniz’s Alpha platform in 2007 put Azerbaijan literally on the map as a gas exporter, with a capability to deliver gas to Georgia and Turkey via the South Caucasus Pipeline. But the startup of Shah Deniz Phase 2 (Bravo platform) in 2018 topped up a whole new list of superlatives including: first subsea development in the Caspian Sea; largest subsea infrastructure operated by BP worldwide; and the point from which the 3500-km SGC pipeline network begins its journey to deliver Caspian gas to Europe. In his interview in March, the Atlantic Council’s John Roberts raised doubts as to whether Azerbaijan could boost gas production enough to fill the SGC’s planned 10 Bcm per year capacity, noting that his own calculations suggest “we are not likely to see more than 5 Bcm per year added to Azerbaijani supply over the next 4 years or so.” Azerbaijan says it is on track to fulfil an agreement to significantly boost its exports to the EU between now and 2027. So how to plug that 5 Bcm per year gap? Why not reduce domestic consumption which, Roberts said, “brings us to renewables” and the question of whether Azerbaijan can tap into enough offshore wind power (and solar) to make more natural gas available for export. The World Bank estimates that Azerbaijan could be producing 7 GW of power from Caspian Sea winds by 2040, and Baku is lining up partners to take the challenge seriously. So, have hydrocarbons had their day in the “Land of Fire” which conceived the modern oil and gas industry 2 centuries ago? Hardly. While Equinor may be selling its Azerbaijani assets, the UAE, which hosted COP28 and now passes the gavel to Azerbaijan, has picked up a 30% stake in the Absheron gas and condensate field. Hungary’s state-owned energy conglomerate MVM is buying a 5% stake in Shah Deniz gas, building on its 2020 purchases of Chevron’s stakes in BP’s ACG oil project and the BTC (Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan) export pipeline. Azerbaijan’s Trend news agency reports that SOCAR, TotalEnergies, and ADNOC will decide by year-end 2024 or early 2025 on declaring FID on Phase 2 of the Absheron gas project, which would raise production to 5.5 Bcm per year for export to Europe. Absheron Phase 1 went onstream in September 2023 with 1.5 Bcm per year that is currently sold on Azerbaijan’s domestic market. For Further Reading The Pivotal Role of Azerbaijan Oil and Baku by J.

Dengyi, L. Rouis, and L. Xiaoliang, et al. It was American Thanksgiving 1992 and less than a year after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. William Courtney had arrived as the first US Ambassador to the newly independent state of Kazakhstan. He decided to host Thanksgiving dinner and invite the entire American community in Almaty—all 20 of us—or were we fewer? Let’s just say we all fitted around one rather large oval table at what was then the best hotel in Kazakhstan—the communist party hotel. The new chef was a Texan from San Antonio, and he did his best to transform chickens from the local market and a sort of red berry sauce that passed for cranberry into a meal fit for pilgrims. Afterall, that’s what we were, pilgrims who had journeyed long distances to some sacred place. The conversation was riveting—journalists, entrepreneurs, diplomats, adventurers, all children of the Cold War crystal balling the future. I was in town as both journalist and entrepreneur hoping to launch a business news service on behalf of a so-called investor (with no money) who had recruited three gullible freelance journalists—including myself—from Kiev in Ukraine. After covering Ukraine’s independence vote, wading in the Dnieper River, skirting the roadblock at the entrance to Chernobyl while living in a communal apartment on Karl Marx Street in downtown Kiev, Kazakhstan sounded exotic if not foreboding. But back to Thanksgiving dinner 1992 in Almaty. Ambassador Courtney and US Deputy Chief of Mission Jackson McDonald bantered about how global politics might be reordered in the wake of the Soviet collapse and one comment has stuck with me to this day some 30 years later—pay attention, they told us, to where the Caspian and Central Asian states might pivot. They were right, and while Kazakhstan pivoted in multiple directions—Russia, China and the West—to balance those three behemoths; Azerbaijan turned to Turkey, a natural fit culturally and linguistically, that has positioned Baku as a supplier of oil and gas to Europe. On my first trip to Baku in 1994 I didn’t just smell the crude oil in the air, I could taste it as the taxi (always a Soviet Fiat-style Lada with no meter) sped through the Bibi-Heybat oil fields enroute from the airport and a moonscape with rusty pump jacks pumping came into focus. To the right, were red tiled roofs of what looked like houses in a suburban subdivision you might find in Europe or North America—an odd sight considering the usual Soviet grey block architecture everywhere else. Though it might have been an urban myth, the driver explained that the houses had been built for foreign managers who produced the fields before the Russian Revolution. Ahead as we approached the outskirts of Baku was the Ateshgah fire temple built in the 17th and 18th Centuries for Hindu, Sikh, and Zoroastrian worship. The secret of their god of fire: natural gas which the Soviets piped in after natural seeps stopped flowing in the 1960s—having a fire temple was still good for tourism. I was one of a dedicated group of energy journalists who visited Baku while on the Caspian exhibition circuit which included Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan around the time that Azerbaijan’s President Heydar Aliyev announced “The Contract of the Century” with a literal “Who’s Who” of international partners at that first major oil and gas exhibition in Baku. The PSA between Azerbaijan’s state oil company SOCAR and a consortium of 11 foreign oil companies from six countries aimed to develop the Azeri, Chirag, and Deepwater Gunashli oil fields (ACG) in Azerbaijan’s sector of the Caspian Sea. On the Sidelines of History, We Did Have Our Fun While today’s HSE managers would faint at the thought, we once talked a Soviet helicopter pilot to take us out over the Caspian to buzz the production platform at the ACG project area. The rusty chopper in desperate need of a new paint job stayed airborne miraculously as we strained against our seatbelts when a crew member threw open the side door and the pilot banked to give us a clear view as he circled the platform. One disappointment: we failed to get permission to land—I wonder why? In Baku the newly built Hyatt was the only “real” hotel in terms of most tastes but only The Wall Street Journal or CNN could afford it and those of us with the trade media were often freelancers without a travel budget. I stayed on the 14th floor of the Absheron—a Soviet disaster area overlooking Independence Square where riots and a massacre had occurred 4 years earlier. The Absheron had a secret. With ownership of everything up for grabs everywhere in the post-Soviet world, the Absheron had been divided between its employees who controlled individual floors like private fiefdoms. The fellow who created the profit center on the 14th floor knew how to please foreigners on meager budgets. He tidied things up, did some painting and most importantly replaced the burned-out light bulbs. He bought new curtains and hired an English-speaking receptionist, aka the cashier, who took only hard currency and only in cash. As for recreation, who needed a tour guide? Ask any enterprising driver out to make a few bucks with a dilapidated Lada and you would be whisked around for an afternoon to visit the Dashgil mud volcanos and marvel at Paleolithic petroglyphs at nearby Gobustan. Note: My foot (and leg with it) slipped into one of those mud volcanos once and thankfully my cab hire acted before the rest of me followed. A more scientific exploration of the inner workings of Azerbaijan’s mud volcanos can be found here. Finally, let’s not forget the Yanar Dag 10-meter-long wall of fire that has been erupting from methane seeps for decades outside of Baku. Another enterprising entrepreneur opened a café a safe distance across from the flames where modern day fire worshipers sip tea while contemplating the methane emitting natural wonder. It will be a different world when international guests gather in Baku for COP29 to plan the next industrial revolution 30 years after Azerbaijan rose like a phoenix from the ashes of the Soviet collapse. There will be fun but it will be far tamer. For Further Reading OTC 15120 Seismic Interpretation and Classification of Mud Volcanoes of the South Caspian Basin, Offshore Azerbaijan by M.Z.

,https://jpt.spe.org/a-new-magazine-for-a-new-era-jpt-and-the-global-petroleum-landscape-in-1949,"In January of 1949, a new publication jostled for its place amidst the sudden abundance of titles devoted to technical professional associations. The publishing marketplace, like every other, was evolving daily in a world that hoped technological leaps never before imagined would not only leave behind recent global tragedy but also make its recurrence impossible. Volume 1, Number 1 of the Journal of Petroleum Technology—then the official publication of the Petroleum Branch of the AIME—wore an efficient but striking clover-green-and-cream cover, its 92 pages containing sections devoted to editorials, AIME-wide developments, upcoming meetings, feature articles, and technical papers (including, famously, a paper on a new technique that author J.B. Clark dubbed “Hydrafrac”). The teaser text for Branch Chair I.W. Alcorn’s inaugural Editorial Comment framed the new magazine as “the kingpin of a broadened branch program and a real force in strengthening the profession if members will but use it to carry opinion and incite action.” As JPT celebrates its 75th anniversary, a brief review of the global petroleum landscape during its first year of publication casts new light on the magazine itself—and the lofty expectations attached to the industry it supported. Before a rebuilt world could be fueled by petroleum, the conditions of its peace had to be defined, and thus its eyes were on Europe in 1949. The Marshall Plan had enabled a major uptick in European oil production, such that Western Europe produced just over 11 million bbl in 1949 in countries such as the Netherlands, France, and the just-established Federal Republic of Germany. More than a decade distant were offshore discoveries that would revolutionize Europe’s role in global petroleum, but at the time of JPT’s launch, Europe remained a potential trigger for a war that all were desperate to avoid—indeed, in the UK, wartime rationing had not yet ended, and in the year of JPT’s debut, the petrol ration was increased to allow a generous 180 miles per month. While the globe remained in upheaval as anticolonial rebellions were launched—mostly against European empires—and attempts were made to fill power vacuums, the showdown between the West and the Soviet Bloc had solidified into a dangerous reality that cast a shadow over every nation. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization was ratified in April, and the following month, the blockade of Berlin came to an end in what was seen as a major symbolic victory for the West, evident proof that its reliance upon technology could safeguard humanity. JPT wasted no time, however, in drawing attention to another part of the world that had already been positioned as the industry’s next focal point. The January issue featured the article “Middle Eastern Oil and Its Importance to the World” by Standard Oil’s John R. Suman, in which the author described the inevitability of the region’s economic ascendancy as the result of its oil reserves (35 billion bbl at the time of the article’s writing). While avoiding specific discussion of the political strife that the region had already experienced since the end of the war, Suman, like so many other analysts of the time, explicitly connected its powerhouse potential to the dream of a stable future: “The present program for European recovery makes it (the Middle East) the key to avoidance of another early war. I don't know of anything that could be much more important than that.” Petroleum development was seen not merely as a key to prosperity, but to peace itself. Recognizing that petroleum infrastructure and production would be vital to the success of the Marshall Plan, Suman and his colleagues understood that the oil-producing nations of the Middle East would soon be “transforming an area of great and almost universal want into one of general prosperity and comfort.” Indeed, the period was transformative for the Middle East; the very next year, its crude petroleum exports would increase by almost 50%, and it would surpass the Caribbean as the world’s largest crude-exporting region. While most activity at the time was centered in Iran, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia, E&P efforts would soon lead to gigantic leaps in production in neighboring nations as well. Such growth was not, of course, only occurring in areas politically or economically dominated by the West. Behind the Iron Curtain, the coast of the Caspian Sea had long been an important source of oil for the Soviet Union, whose Azerbaijani republic produced 75% of the country’s oil during the war and which had been the target of a failed German offensive to starve the Red Army of its fuel. But in November of 1949—the same month that JPT published a column by AIME President L.E. Young cautioning vigilance against the infiltrations of socialism even as the organization reaffirmed its official policy of nonparticipation in all things political—Soviet engineers operating from a shed atop a small Caspian island struck oil 1000 m under the seabed. The discovery, soon named Oil Rocks, would lead to the world’s first offshore oil platform and an infrastructural investment that would bloom at its peak into a network of 2,000 drilling platforms, an otherworldly floating city the Soviets long upheld as a technological feat to rival anything constructed by the West. In the Pacific Rim, petroleum production had begun to regain strength after the cataclysm of Imperial Japan’s expansion and defeat; by mid-1950, 195,000 B/D would be produced in the region, an amount that may seem extremely modest until one considers the violence that had scorched its islands and mountains for much longer than the official duration of World War II. The importance of petroleum to the economic and social development of East Asia had long been recognized, and in fact much of Japan’s wartime strategy had been motivated by its need to secure petroleum resources in the Dutch-held East Indies. The geopolitical vacuum left by Japan’s surrender was quickly filled by the Allies; in what would become South Korea, for example, a trio of American oil companies reached agreements with the new nation’s US-backed government in 1949 intended to stabilize its future and guarantee American influence. That influence, and the creation of a new American ally, was to be secured at a terrible price only months later. Oil was certainly not a primary cause of the Korean War, but the zeal to create a global economic network locked into industrialization, and the petroleum that powered it, mirrored the geopolitical course of the Cold War. Throughout Asia, as elsewhere, populations long under the domain of colonizers and invaders saw the end of the war as a moment of long-sought freedom but did not always anticipate that these freedoms might be delayed, and indeed sometimes opposed, by a new order that saw technology as the most-important agent of personal liberty. The colonial quest for Africa’s resources and land may have been centuries old, but the acceleration of that quest into the historical “Scramble” at the close of the 19th century was hardly ancient history in 1949. With the end of the world war, these colonial empires faced growing pressures they could not withstand. African troops had fought with distinction on every front of the war in the Allied cause of freedom, and many, upon their return or demobilization, saw the resumption of colonial dependence in peacetime as an impossibility. At the time of JPT’s debut, Egypt, a kingdom that remained firmly in the sphere of British influence, was responsible for 99% of the 16 million bbl of African oil produced that year. In terms of the new petroleum-centric world, Africa was seen primarily as the neighbor of the Middle East’s abundant fields—but that would change dramatically in the next decade, when vast discoveries in Algeria, Angola, Libya, Nigeria, and elsewhere would transform the continent and its role on the international stage. As oil was discovered and produced in massive amounts, nascent independence movements discovered new leverage, and Africa quickly became arguably the most inflamed of Cold War battlefields. Latin America was central to the world oil scene at the time of JPT’s launch, mostly because of its star performer Venezuela. The nation was the world’s second-largest producer of oil that year at nearly 1.6 million bbl, and the world’s largest exporter of crude. A brief period of democracy had ended the previous year, and the new military government was determined to take firmer hold of the national oil industry and its profits. It thus extended a fateful invitation in 1949 to four other major oil-producing nations—Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia—to consider formation of a body that would represent the interest of oil producers as a counterbalance to the US and its corporate “Seven Sisters” that dominated the world’s oil industry. While the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries would not be chartered officially until 1960, it would not be long before the effect of Venezuela’s initiative would be felt globally. In the meantime, Colombia, Argentina, Trinidad, and Peru were building their own industries throughout 1949, with Colombia in particular, despite struggling through a bitter civil conflict that had erupted the previous year, showing great promise for the future. Unsurprisingly, JPT’s focus during its first year was on North America. The magazine’s content was, then as now, member-centric, and most members were in the US; thus, its pages brought readers news of the establishment of the new Petroleum Division of AIME, branch activities and growth, spirited exchanges about the desirability—or lack thereof—of engineering specialization within the industry, and technical programs for upcoming meetings in San Francisco, California, and San Antonio, Texas. But momentous industrywide events also were unfolding in North America. The Spraberry Trend had begun to produce, heralding a shift to the Permian Basin in domestic production that would endure until the offshore boom. And in that domain, 1949 saw a critical technological development as the Breton Rig 20, the first offshore (specifically, out of sight of land) drilling rig, began operations in the Breton Sound of the Gulf of Mexico (GOM). More than 40 wells were producing in the GOM by year’s end. Mexico itself, long a top world producer, made agreements with US drilling contractors in March to handle operations for the first time since the nationalization of its oil industry a decade earlier. Finally, the December issue of JPT featured an article by Imperial Oil’s J.C. Gustafson highlighting the fact that 45 rigs were then active in the increasingly important Devonian pools of Alberta, Canada. In the wake of World War II, the industrialized nations of the world, riding the momentum of technological accomplishment and cooperation that had destroyed the Axis, took it as their right to organize the globe’s recovery and label its identity. Often failing to consider the realities and desires of the hundreds of millions of people affected by their policies, they believed that an optimistic embrace of technology would prevent a recurrence of what had just been endured. Viewed the better part of a century later, such optimism can present an easy target: quaint if not naïve, the result of an all-encompassing consumerism bursting forth from a resurgent US and, as told in the West at any rate, sweeping all before it. But one can hardly begrudge optimism, whatever its strain, in a global population emerging from the darkest years in recorded human history. Certainly in our own time, we, too, doggedly link technological progress with the betterment of human civilization—and, just as in 1949, hope that prosperity brings peace. Crediting the debut of JPT to these impulses may seem grandiose, but it is clear enough from a review of the magazine’s first year, and the industry to which it was devoted, that its creation was born of more than merely a committee vote. It was, in fact, an attempt to chronicle an unmistakably new era. For Further Reading Petroleum Developments in Europe in 1949 by F.E. Von Estorff, AAPG Bulletin (1950).

Every adult human would, in 1949, have been familiar with the notion of technology’s destructive potential. While petroleum had powered the Allied drive to victory, developments in aeronautics, metallurgy, chemistry, and a host of other sciences also had proved critical. The most universally identifiable of these, of course, was the creation of the atomic bomb. When JPT’s first issue shipped, the “nuclear club” still counted a membership of one, but that member harbored no illusions about the inevitability of proliferation. In Commander Robert C. Wing’s paper “Potentialities of Atomic Warfare Against the U.S. Petroleum Industry,” published in the September 1949 issue of the Proceedings of the United States Naval Institute, the positivist view of these devastating weapons that can seem so alien to modern sensibilities is evident but is tempered with the acknowledgment that the US’s all-important petroleum industry appeared deeply vulnerable. “When war comes, and if with it comes the atomic bomb,” Wing wrote, “the refinery industry because of its concentrated nature will be in an unenviable status if it is selected as a high-priority target objective.” Despite the infrastructure’s potentially “unenviable status,” however, Wing predicted that US ports, because of their sheer size, would be able to endure a nuclear attack and continue their important functions. “It is unlikely that atomic bomb production can achieve, at least in our time, anything like mass production.” Here, one sees an optimism that seems now at odds with the science it supports. But, as always, context remains critical, and in 1949, nuclear deterrence was viewed by many as a guarantor of peace rather than as a constant existential threat. In any case, the apprehension of Wing, and others who foresaw the spread of nuclear weapons, was well-placed. On 29 August, likely only weeks after Wing had finished writing his paper, and a full 3 years earlier than American and British analysts had anticipated its ability to do so, the Soviet Union successfully tested its 21-kiloton bomb “First Lightning” in what is now Kazakhstan. The “club” was exclusive no more. For Further Reading Potentialities of Atomic Warfare Against the U.S. Petroleum Industry by Robert C.

,https://jpt.spe.org/the-hse-journey-a-look-at-spes-accomplishments-and-the-way-forward,"Congratulations to SPE’s Journal of Petroleum Technology (JPT) on its 75th anniversary. This milestone presents a good opportunity to look back on SPE’s longstanding commitment to promoting a safe, healthy, environmentally friendly, sustainable, and secure workplace for everyone working in the oil and gas industry, both onshore and offshore. As I prepared to write this article, I reread a guest editorial I wrote for JPT after the 2012 SPE International HSE Conference and Exhibition focused on “The Growing Importance of HSES-SR in Our Industry.” The good news is that SPE has remained active in promoting conferences and workshops as well as enhancing competencies across the spectrum of HSE subdisciplines. Challenges remain, however, in engaging functional leaders across our industry and achieving more consistency related to industrywide HSE culture, leadership, management systems, risk management, and sustainable development. Another historical challenge facing our industry continues to be how to learn from the past and more effectively share lessons learned in HSE with the objective of pursuing continual improvement in all we do. A strength of SPE has been, and continues to be, the ability to convene and leverage the expertise of our global members and sister organizations in achieving this objective, as well as identifying and developing innovative, engaging, and sustainable approaches to turn this objective into a reality. My goal in this article is to share with you some of the HSE accomplishments we’ve had over the past several years in this industry, as well as what the future might hold. Unfortunately, given the breadth of the HSE discipline, it is not possible to do adequate justice to the large number of proactive initiatives pursued by SPE over the past several years, so I’ve tried to highlight a handful of those items I felt were most impactful as a result of SPE engagement. SPE hosted its first international HSE conference in 1991 and has held numerous international and regional conferences ever since. As evidence of SPE’s recognition of the importance of HSE to oil and gas activities, the first technical directors were added to the SPE Board of Directors in 2001, with the role of HSE technical director established in 2002. The scope of the HSE role was expanded to include security and social risk management in 2007, and sustainable development was added in 2014. From 2010 to 2014, I was privileged to serve as the fourth HSE technical director on the SPE Board of Directors. I want to thank my predecessors in that role for establishing a strong HSE foundation on which to build, and I hope I was able to do the same for my successors. My exposure to the global HSE community within SPE allowed me to more fully recognize the extent to which HSE crosses all discipline boundaries, as well as the extent to which HSE affects other parts of the oil and gas industry and more broadly other industries. It is important that we continually look outside our normal boundaries so that we can learn from one another, as well as share all of the great initiatives SPE and its members have developed on the upstream side of the business. The oil and gas industry has always been focused on HSE excellence; however, there have been some defining events that have served to remind us of the high-risk nature associated with our industry. Some of the major events affecting the way we do things today include Piper Alpha (July 1988), the Exxon Valdez spill (March 1989), and the Macondo Deepwater Horizon (April 2010). These events all served to highlight and emphasize the importance of the following HSE focus areas: Important regulatory reforms targeting HSE improvements were adopted following the Macondo disaster and mandated safety and environmental management systems (SEMS) intended to avoid repeating the organizational and management lapses that led to Macondo. Also adopted were regulations targeting technology such as tightened regulations for well control and production safety systems. The industry also created the Center for Offshore Safety (COS), which focuses on SEMS implementation and assessments. Industry and government have collaborated on improved near-miss and other safety-indicator data collection and sharing designed to inform decision-making about systemic risk management, with one objective being to transition from over-reliance on lagging indicators to more effective and consistent leading indicators. I’m happy to note that SPE has been actively engaged throughout all of these changes to promote dialogue related to effective implementation. The lessons learned from the Piper Alpha disaster were numerous and reach far beyond the offshore oil industry, across all hazardous industries, and are every bit as relevant today. Key among these findings was the lack of an effective safety culture, which fostered the belief that everything was fine, as well as several deficiencies in the management of change, process safety, internal communication processes, and emergency response procedures. Before the Macondo disaster, many in the industry found it difficult to imagine an accident in the US that would result in a major oil spill, loss of lives, injuries, and the sinking of a rig. This then led the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine to convene an expert committee to identify ways in which the offshore oil and gas industry, government, and other stakeholders can strengthen the industry’s safety culture. The report and its companion summary, “Beyond Compliance: Strengthening the Safety Culture of the Offshore Oil and Gas Industry,” were issued in 2016. On a more recent note, you may recall a Japan Airlines crash and explosion on 2 January 2024, where all 379 passengers and crew aboard the aircraft survived. This accomplishment was attributed in large part to the positive effect of a strong safety culture and good training and the benefits of applying lessons learned. The airline recognized that something going wrong presents an opportunity to view the situation in terms of how it can learn. It also recognized that many employees were joining the company without a memory of prior accidents, so understanding how much effort goes into maintaining an effective safety program was important. Sound familiar? I found this airline incident to be a great reminder of the importance of a strong safety culture and the need for continuous reinforcement of the principles and management commitment. The importance of a strong culture has been the focus of several industry organizations such as SPE, the COS, the Offshore Operators Committee (OOC), the American Petroleum Institute (API), the International Association of Drilling Contractors (IADC), and the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers. SPE has actively worked, and continues to do so, with all of the aforementioned organizations and other experts in promoting discussion around establishing and embedding an effective safety culture as part of its various international and regional HSE conferences globally. The day that the industry feels it has achieved its objectives in the area of safety culture should be a warning sign to everyone that more needs to be done to ensure that the culture is sustained as all companies, regardless of size or global scope, go through their normal organizational and staffing changes over the years. As stated by Capt. Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger following his safe landing of a commercial jet on the Hudson River in 2009, “Safety can no longer be defined solely as the absence of accidents.” A prerequisite for effectively addressing HSE program requirements in our operations is first to have in place structured management systems that provide for continuous and visible management commitment and leadership throughout the organization, from the most senior management level to the operations, project, or office worker. All oil and gas companies, regardless of their scale or where they operate, must establish a clear and consistent vision for developing HSE management systems, along with related processes, programs, and tools to enable the organization to safely explore, develop, and produce oil and gas resources in a manner compatible with the balanced environmental and economic needs of the communities in which they operate. The establishment of structured and disciplined management systems provides a mechanism for guiding the standardized execution and improvement of HSE processes, with one of the most significant being the expectation for management to visibly demonstrate leadership, commitment, and accountability for HSE system implementation and performance throughout the life cycle of the asset. Individual roles and responsibilities also must be clearly established, accepted, and exercised, with each individual having a sense of personal accountability for items within their sphere of influence. The API first published its Recommended Practice 75 in May 1993 to provide consistent guidance to the oil and gas industry on how to develop management programs that were designed to “promote safety and environmental protection” during operations. Recognizing that the industry has evolved, technology has advanced, and operations have changed and understanding that management systems and human performance have progressed, the API continued to enhance RP 75 and most recently issued the fourth edition in 2019. Implementation of SEMS principles was initially voluntary for operators working in the Gulf of Mexico; subsequent to the Macondo disaster, however, the US Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) promulgated rules making the development and implementation of SEMS mandatory. SPE remains active in promoting SEMS development and compliance at its various international and regional events with the objective of leadership, management of change, emergency response, risk management and assessment, and facility design, among others. From 2009 to 2016, SPE facilitated a series of global sessions on the advancement of HSE in oil and gas. More than 850 leaders from various disciplines contributed to the discussion. The work effort culminated in a workshop at the 2016 SPE International HSES Conference in Stavanger, followed by the issuance of a report, “Getting to Zero and Beyond” (Fig. 1). SPE industry experts managing this effort were tasked with identifying a path to achieve a step change in performance focused on the expectation of zero harm (Fig. 2). The discussion of the importance of human factors included the factors that influence the interaction of people with one another, with the facilities and equipment, and with the management systems and working practices used to organize and manage the way work is carried out within the industry. The report concluded with the following recommendations: SPE remains focused on identifying ways to turn these recommendations into action. Included among these steps are promoting Getting to Zero-type panel discussions and papers at SPE conferences and workshops, including at non‑HSE technical events, and maintaining its Human Factors Technical Section as a way to actively engage members globally. Another important collaboration occurred when SPE partnered with the National Academies Gulf Research Program’s Safer Offshore Energy Systems Summit in May 2018 that identified a large number of follow-up ideas aimed at improving overall offshore safety performance. Participating organizations included COS, OOC, IADC, BSEE, and the US Coast Guard. On the process safety front, SPE recognized a gap in the scope of its HSE activities as it related to process safety and held a 2017 workshop to conduct a process safety gap analysis. The American Institute of Chemical Engineers’ Center for Chemical Process Safety was invited to participate given its long history and technical credibility in this discipline. The workshop was designed to gain a better understanding of all process safety work that was underway by various organizations with the objective of identifying areas of overlap and perceived gaps of interest for SPE members. At the 10th anniversary of the Macondo disaster, the Gulf Research Program established a study group focused on “Advancing Understanding of Offshore Oil and Gas Systemic Risk in the US Gulf of Mexico.” This group was tasked with defining the current profile of systemic risks offshore, including an assessment of how changes over the years have contributed to increasing or decreasing systemic risks since Macondo. A key outcome included in this report is the “Risk Profile for Offshore Oil and Gas” (Fig. 3), which highlights 15 risk elements that contribute to an effective systemic risk management program. Each of these areas represents an opportunity for SPE to collaborate with the Gulf Research Program and other organizations to develop workshops and training to promote a better understanding of the concept and identify actionable steps for companies, both onshore and offshore, recognizing that individual companies will be at different maturity level for each element. One of the initiatives resulting from the Macondo disaster was development of an industrywide framework to capture and analyze safety data from all companies operating in the Gulf of Mexico. This initiative stemmed from SPE’s efforts to partner with BSEE on a summit in April 2016 to discuss the benefits of sharing key safety data among companies with the intent of flagging trends of concerns and prospective mitigative actions. SPE issued a report on the summit findings in September 2016. This summit included representatives from non-US oil and gas regulators, as well as representatives from other industry sectors such as aviation. The concept of industrywide HSE data sharing was supported by several HSE organizations, including the International Regulator’s Forum, which reported at the conclusion of its Global Safety Forum in June 2018 that “The opportunity for the next step change in safety performance appears to be in a substantial increase in the sharing of data across industry. Leading practices in other industries (i.e., transportation) may be adopted in the oil and gas industry to similar effect … .” A key outcome from the SPE/BSEE summit was development of a pilot safety data management framework named SafeOCS, which was funded by BSEE and managed by the US Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS), a neutral third party that collects and reports data that operators share voluntarily on incidents associated with their activities. SafeOCS is intended to focus on near‑miss and significant observation data residing in the lower half of the traditional safety triangle (Fig. 4) to identify those safety events where a difference set of circumstances could result in a near miss transitioning to an injury or, even worse, a fatality. Details on the SafeOCS program are provided in the BTS report issued in October 2019. A good activity for SPE is to identify opportunities for industry to use aggregated industry data to develop effective leading indicators. Sustainability, nontechnical risk, environmental and social performance, as well as corporate (social) responsibility are interrelated terms that refer to an important set of competencies viewed as increasingly strategic in value for the oil and gas industry. Securing and maintaining license to operate extends well beyond legislative and regulatory permitting to encompass both the mitigation of adverse social and environmental effects as well as the advancement of financial, societal, and environmental benefits via the execution of strong sustainability performance. Given the increasing prominence of sustainability for the oil and gas industry, SPE embarked on a path in 2010 when it created a Sustainable Development Task Force to explore SPE’s role and strategy in addressing sustainability, propose a methodical approach to sustainability for our industry, and participate in global sustainability discussions. In 2014, the SPE Board approved and adopted SPE’s definition of sustainable development (Fig. 5). The HSE discipline then developed a business plan that addressed how this key strategic topic could be implemented for the benefit of SPE’s members worldwide. The overarching near-term objectives included accelerating the integration of sustainability elements across the life cycle management systems and operations of oil and gas activities, promoting performance improvements in sustainability within the upstream oil and gas industry, spotlighting best practices and facilitating deployment of lessons learned across SPE, and building a framework to support individual and corporate capabilities on existing and emerging sustainability topics. Related to the latter objective, SPE then focused on competency development plans as the optimal way for SPE to integrate these principles across industry globally. The importance of this program can best be summarized by feedback received by one of our members, who said, “You can have the best technical people in the world, but, if you don’t have sustainability covered, you probably don’t have a project.” Among SPE’s current efforts in this area, the HSE discipline continues to further progress plans related to the SPE GAIA Sustainability Program, which was created to enable individuals in our industry to act in the service of sustainable socioeconomic development through their professional societies. As stated on SPE’s website, the objective is to empower those at all levels within organizations to create actions to address the planet’s sustainability challenges. As noted earlier, one of the key challenges for the industry as a whole is the dissemination of information and sharing lessons learned. In addition to addressing these topics as part of the many SPE conferences, workshops, and forums, as well as topical videos on SPE Energy Stream and HSE-related articles in JPT. SPE launched its HSE Now digital publication in 2013. This publication is intended to capture technical information affecting the health, safety, security, environment, social responsibility, regulation, and quality aspects of the upstream oil and gas industry. To encourage sharing pertinent information from sources outside of the oil and gas industry, the decision was made to place HSE Now outside the SPE firewall to allow members and nonmembers alike to access the information. As noted earlier, one of SPE’s key’s strengths is its ability to convene gatherings of experts to discuss topics of general interest to the industry, as well as collaborate with other organizations and societies to leverage learnings from other industry sectors facing similar challenges. Several areas of commonality exist among all sectors, including personnel and process safety, risk assessment and management, and the use of management systems and data analysis to guide decision-making. Also, recognizing that most safety and risk management practices are not proprietary, opportunities exist for industries, government, and universities to work together to share experiences, case studies, and best practices across sectors so that successful approaches can be applied to different industry settings to improve safety performance. It, therefore, will be very important for SPE to continue its efforts to collaborate or partner with other organizations and societies to share best practices and lessons learned with a broader audience both internal and external to the oil and gas industry. As HSE challenges continue to emerge, the question we must ask ourselves is whether we, as an industry and as integrated organizations, are prepared to meet these challenges. How do we prepare for the foreseeable future, and what do we need to do to prepare for the unknown challenges that lie ahead? This is where SPE can play a role. As an industry, we need to focus on our license to operate, its scope and resulting expectations, and how to earn and protect that trust. All aspects of this industry have a vested interest in getting it right, because what happens to one company essentially affects everyone. We see lots of new faces working in the oil and gas sector because of retirements; it is crucial that SPE continues its efforts with the objective of keeping the memory of these and other catastrophic events from fading away. So, as SPE and its global members look to the future, the following are areas for SPE to continue progressing and promoting its initiatives: My challenge to everyone is to take advantage of the various programs and publications that SPE and its partners have to offer to help your organizations meet the growing challenges of HSE in our industry. A key to achieving this is our global members who are willing to volunteer their expertise in planning events and sharing their experiences. Taking a look back at some of the HSE accomplishments of SPE and the industry over the past several years hopefully provides a good example of how the collective power and expertise of our members and partners can help define the way forward.

,https://jpt.spe.org/data-science-has-exploded-across-the-industry-over-the-past-75-years,"In 1957, the Journal of Petroleum Technology published an article titled “Application of Large Computers to Reservoir Engineering Problems.” That was the first reference in JPT to what became known as supercomputers. The high-speed computers used in the 1957 article were capable of performing 60 million operations in about 3½ hours. They were proposed to analyze the thorny problem of multiphase flow. “It presently appears that the large computer will be required to investigate multiphase flow and to predict the flow behavior of oil and gas reservoirs considering two- and three-space dimensions.” Now, 67 years later, supercomputer speeds are measured in trillions of operations per second, and investigating multiphase flow is just one of the many uses. This extreme growth in speed has given rise to artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), which has found its way into almost every corner of the petroleum industry. The Society of Petroleum Engineers and JPT has kept up with the digital advances in the industry, holding countless conferences, symposia, and other meetings centered on the digital aspects of the industry and recently creating the Data Science and Engineering Analytics (DSEA) technical discipline. In 2019, SPE launched the Data Science and Digital Engineering in Upstream Oil and Gas online publication. Four leaders in the oil and gas digital space shared their views on the current state of data science in the industry and the future of the discipline. Sushma Bhan, currently on the board of directors for Ikon Science, is SPE’s Technical Director for DSEA. Before joining Ikon, she worked for Shell for 32 years, eventually rising to the role of chief data officer for subsurface and wells. “My journey in the oil and gas industry began in 1988, when I joined Shell’s Production Computing Assisted Operations team as a programmer analyst,” Bhan said. “During my time there, I gained valuable exposure to field production operations and developed a deep understanding of real‑time data.” Jim Crompton, who is mostly retired, is an affiliate professor of petroleum engineering at the Colorado School of Mines, a faculty fellow at the school’s Payne Institute for Public Policy, and director of Reflections Data Consulting. “My academic career started out in exploration geophysics, so my first introduction to engineering analytics came from processing seismic data at Chevron Geophysical Company in Houston,” Crompton said. “I studied earthquake seismology in graduate school, but, when I graduated, I learned the oil and gas industry paid a lot more than the USGS did, so my career goals changed.” Shahab D. Mohaghegh is a professor at West Virginia University and the president of Intelligent Solutions. “Since I started working for the petroleum industry throughout the world using artificial intelligence in 2000, I was able to work with actual data (field measurements) that has been saved by all the companies,” Mohaghegh said. “Working with actual data using AI provided several technologies that have been incredibly fantastic compared to what we have done in the past.” Pushpesh Sharma, the chair of the DSEA Technical Section, holds a PhD degree in chemical engineering from the University of Houston and is senior product manager for Aspen Technology. “Till a few years ago, the focus was on proving the efficacy of data science/machine learning methods for energy use cases,” Sharma said. “However, in recent years, the concerns are around large-scale deployment, maintenance, and the black-box nature of ML models. Because of that, I started seeing increased focus on the deployment, explainability, and trust of ML models.” JPT: How have advancements in technology affected the discipline? Are there any technologies that you find particularly promising for the future? Bhan: In recent years, technological innovations have significantly impacted the oil and gas sector. These advancements span system architecture, computing power, and software development, and they have broadened the applicability of data science across all aspects of the industry. The convergence of innovative technology, data science, and AI hold great promise for driving efficiency, accelerating digital transformation, improved sustainability focus, and timely informed decision-making across the industry. As we move forward, let’s prioritize data readiness for AI, integrity, and its easy access to unlock the full potential of data sciences to support affordable worldwide energy needs. Crompton: The technology foundation of the digital oil field started with advances in sensors, followed by communications and networking in often challenging field (and downhole) conditions including internet-of-things devices and cloud computing. Advances in computing from data center scale like high-performance computing and GPU [graphics processing unit] chips to small-scale processing you can carry with you on your laptop allow more data and larger models to be developed. Advances in data visualization and in the human/machine interface help the human engineers to interact better with all this data. But, of course, data quality and the lack of comprehensive data standards is a constant and persistent barrier. In the future, artificial intelligence/machine learning and generative AI will help us build larger data-driven predictive models, but the challenge is will they be accurate enough to make better decisions. That is a data quality challenge as well. Finding the best, trusted data to use in developing a model is the key step in machine learning, not which algorithm you use. Engineering analysis is not new to the petroleum engineering discipline. Advances from the last century have led from computational fluid dynamics to mass balance to gas composition analysis to decline curve analysis to modern machine-learning-based automated drilling solutions. And there will be further advances in the days and year ahead. Sharma: DSEA, being the Data Science and Engineering Analytics discipline, is always on the forefront of technology because the nature of the data science domain is agile. Almost every day, you hear about a new machine learning algorithm or a new type of data viz service. But I think the biggest change for the DSEA discipline is the advent of generative AI, more specifically large language models (LLMs; e.g., ChatGPT). LLMs have captured the imagination of the global population. A lot of major companies have started working on their version of ChatGPT, including domain specific LLMs. In addition to LLMs, generative AI opens up a variety of other use cases that were unthinkable before, such as generating data/images/content. Generative AI, in my opinion, is the most promising technology for the discipline. JPT: What do you think are the most pressing challenges and opportunities facing the discipline today? Bhan: The Data Science and Engineering Analytics discipline faces dynamic challenges and opportunities that evolve with the business climate. In my view, here are the current challenges: Hybrid Skilled Talent Availability—To meet the demands of this discipline, we need professionals with a blend of expertise in data sciences and petroleum engineering. These individuals must also grasp the latest advancements in computing technology and understand the other related upstream disciplines and the business needs—for example, the need to achieve successful production (exceed past metrics) from early discovery in half the time it was done in the past. There are tremendous opportunities, particularly in automation of day-to-day manual work flows or field maneuvers. For instance, analyzing large data volumes with higher accuracy and precision can replace human errors, as seen in seismic interpretation; eliminate geohazards; lower carbon footprint; and enable predictive analytics used in field operations. DSEA’s progress will be propelled by navigating the challenges while leveraging opportunities to showcase business impact. Crompton: I have always had a slide on this topic in my digital oilfield talks. It hasn’t changed much in over a decade. This is my list of challenges: One new challenge I can see is that many new data sources come from statistical measurements, so the truth is no longer deterministic but probabilistic. We must remember our training in uncertainties (as opposed to measurement error) and probabilities to understand the data-driven models we are developing. Mohaghegh: It seems that the challenges today have to do with marketing and business, not with science and technology. Sharma: The biggest challenge for the DSEA discipline is the inability to capture the business value from ML use cases. We see a lot of AI applications in small scale, but they never make it to large-scale deployment. There are various reasons behind that, but, briefly, the top three are: There are a lot of ideas out there to address these issues, but they still are not widely applicable. JPT: Where do you see the discipline heading in the next decade? Are there any emerging trends or technologies that you think will shape the future? Bhan: The DSEA discipline is poised for significant growth opportunities within the oil and gas industry. I anticipate the most substantial impact in the following areas: These trends align with the broader technological advancements unfolding today, including generative AI, which has the potential to transform businesses across various industries. As we move forward, understanding these trends and systems interdependencies, mitigating potential risks, acquiring the necessary skilled global talent and legal-regulatory, including ethics compliance, will be crucial for organizations to harness their full potential. Crompton: The digital oil field is a reality: New engineers and Earth scientists are entering the workforce with high digital literacy and some training in programming. Petroleum engineering and Earth science “intellectual property” comes in the shape of software. “Innovation at the edge” comes from working on projects; the impact of central research groups is decreasing. New technology developments come from the outside, so innovation is more important than invention. Scaling pilot solutions to enterprise scale is a challenge. Significant gaps continue to surface (lack of reuse, fragile integration, poor data foundation, lack of end-to-end system design). Mohaghegh: I am sure that AI will change everything in petroleum engineering and move it incredibly better than it has till now. Sharma: The DSEA discipline will stay key to profitability due to its implication in energy transition, sustainability, and efficiency. As I mentioned before, generative AI will be an important player in the future. There are certain questions that we would need to answer as a discipline.

,https://jpt.spe.org/experts-give-career-advice-for-future-artificial-lift-professionals-do-not-be-scared-to-try-something-different,"Knowing where to start can be daunting for those new to the oil and gas industry. With all the changes the artificial lift sector has experienced in the past 25 years, the constant is that a new challenge always needs a solution. The spirit of innovation and invention will serve the next generation of artificial lift professionals well. Here are a few nuggets of advice from experts to help newcomers navigate this dynamic sector while also making a difference in the energy world. Greg Stephenson, chief production engineer, Occidental Petroleum My advice is to go for it! While ours is a notoriously cyclical industry, artificial lift professionals tend to enjoy greater job security than many of their counterparts. Also, we get to experiment with new technologies and can often see immediate results from our efforts. I advise any young professional to do what you love and love what you do. If you follow that credo, you can’t go wrong. I feel very fortunate to work in a field that I love. Michael Romer, principal artificial lift engineer, ExxonMobil Network, go to artificial lift events to learn from SPE and others. Artificial lift is a small world. You’ll keep seeing the same people in other roles and places. Get to the field, into the shop, and figure out the challenges firsthand, as not all problems can be solved digitally or won’t tell the entire story. Current lift methods have been around for more than 100 years and will continue. The more things change, the more they stay the same; there’s a long history of learning from industry. Someone may have already solved the problem, and the answer may already exist. Or someone could have tried something you’re considering, and it didn’t work. Artificial lift is a great place to be, with lots of variety. It’s important but not nearly as ‘right now’ as drilling; you can quickly see results, and the costs/risks are generally lower for trying new things. Figure out what you have passion for and own it because others will notice. Laura Labrador, senior production engineer, Ecopetrol Do not take everything as absolute truth. Ask questions before believing. Investigate and consult various opinions from people with experience. We do not need to know everything, but we do need friends who know what we do not know. Finally, teach and transfer your knowledge; this is how you will be able to continue growing. Shauna Noonan, Oxy Fellow and senior director of global supply chain initiatives, Occidental Petroleum Regardless of the cycles and when drilling and completions have halted due to volatile oil prices, the existing wells will still need to be on-production, and most will be on some form of artificial lift. There is always a constant demand for good artificial lift engineers. Jose Ernesto Jaua, global product champion, SLB First, get technically proficient fast. Second, develop strong collaboration and communication skills. Third, try to understand all areas of the oil and gas industry; artificial lift is not isolated, and understanding how it is connected to everything else will make you a more-rounded professional. Last, remember that we are here to create value for our customers, our communities, and the planet in everything we do. I know that any young professional that follows this advice will be set for success! Kevin Leslie, vice president artificial lift solutions, Weatherford International The production arm is typically the last leg of the well cycle when looking at drilling to completion to production. Artificial lift falls into this realm because ALS is ‘Always the Last Solution’ for a well. For all new young professionals entering the artificial lift segment, I would challenge you to help find the next big technology to drive better and faster results in the field. Do not be scared to get your hands dirty; go to the field and learn while trying something different from everyone else. There are several creative ideas in the production space; sometimes, being the first to try might result in something greater. Do not be scared to try something different. Dana Meadows, global portfolio director, artificial lift systems, Baker Hughes My advice to future generations of artificial lift professionals would be to team up with experienced field personnel and ask questions. Question everything—there may be a better way. Try to get as much exposure in front of customers as possible to understand their pain points and solve their issues. Ask for a mentor to help you and listen to key employees to build upon their advice and experiences. This article is part of a 3-part artificial lift series as part of JPT’s 75th Anniversary content.

,https://jpt.spe.org/7-industry-leaders-share-their-insights-on-the-past-present-and-future-of-artificial-lift,"In the past 25 years, the artificial lift industry has seen incredible changes, making hydrocarbon production smarter and more efficient. In this Q&A article, JPT talks with seven industry leaders from this field about its past, present, and future. This conversation showcases the technological progress such as materials, digital tools, and automation and the strategic leadership that has guided the industry to new heights. Join us as we dive into the world of artificial lift and discover the innovation and expertise shaping the future of energy. This roundtable Q&A includes the following participants: JPT: Can you recall an experience, technical paper, or mentor that significantly influenced your early career in artificial lift? How did it shape your approach? Stephenson: Numerous individuals impacted my early career, the most noteworthy being Herald Winkler, who was in the first class of SPE’s Legends of Artificial Lift awarded in 2014. I traveled to my first ATCE in New Orleans as a first-year petroleum engineering student. I distinctly remember walking the exhibit floor and seeing this little guy get mobbed by people asking him questions. I asked one of my fellow students, ‘Who is that guy? Tom Cruise?’ He told me, ‘No. That’s Wink.’ I then learned that Wink was one of the pioneers of gas-lift technology and wrote the first definitive book on the subject. At that moment, I realized that artificial lift might offer a viable career path for me. Eventually, I got to know him personally, first as a student and then as an artificial lift professional. One of the most impactful conversations I had with him was one in which he told me, ‘I am not a gas-lift expert. You cannot be an expert in gas lift—the field is too complex. I’m still learning things, and I’ve been doing this for over 60 years!’ That encounter taught me to be humble in approaching my craft and never assume I knew everything. Romer: My first role in artificial lift was 2 years after I started with ExxonMobil. There was a US production artificial lift team at the time. Some people I worked with closely were Pat Underwood, Mike Johnson, Rodney Bane, and Mark Johnson. Pat was our subject matter expert (SME) for ESPs and rod pumps, and Mike was the SME for gas-lift systems. Rodney was the group manager and had a strong artificial lift background. He was responsible for turning the group into a global one. Mark was a global artificial lift engineering resource. Most of the artificial lift team came up through the field and had great hands-on experience. My background is in electrical engineering, not petroleum, so I was fortunate to learn from them. Labrador: Although it is not exactly an early influence on my career, I can say that it’s the one that most marked my history in the industry. Around a decade ago, when I was working for an operator company in Colombia, a pivotal moment occurred when I presented our progressive cavity pump (PCP) results to the worldwide artificial lift system (ALS) team. In the audience was a remarkable woman, Shauna Noonan, the head of the worldwide ALS team for that company. Her knowledgeable comments and insightful questions left an indelible impression on me. From that day forward, I was inspired to keep working on ALS professionally and take her as a role model. Her guidance continues to shape my career, driving me to strive as a professional woman. Noonan: During one of my co-op internships, Kevin Grondin was my manager with Mobil Canada, and the fields he was responsible for were gas-lifted wells. My assigned project from him was to install the first plunger-lift system in the area. That was my introduction to artificial lift; his enthusiasm made me want to learn more about it. My very first SPE event was the ESP Symposium, and it was women-led. Karen Draper and Carol Magney-Grande convinced me to join the committee. That started with attending and coordinating artificial lift events and realizing that there were strong women leaders in the artificial lift space. Jaua: I have been fortunate in my career to have had many great experiences in the artificial lift world. I grew up professionally in the discipline, starting in the field and working up to managing entire geographies and products at a global scale. If I must select one incredibly enriching period, it was in 2011 when I was assigned to work in Ecuador, managing the artificial lift business covering the Andean region. I had the incredible opportunity to be part of the board of directors of the SPE local chapter, meeting many top industry and government authorities. I developed many initiatives that positively impacted the industry and promoted technologies and local talent. I also took that platform to coach and mentor young professionals. Those moments in which I have been able to impact and contribute to a higher cause have always been the ones I have the best memories of. That experience was transformative for me, and since then, every time I change position or location, I invest effort and time to be engaged with the communities and mentor others whenever I can. Leslie: Thinking back to my early career, one person stood out as an influence in my artificial lift career: Larry Hoes, the vice president of oil field for Lufkin Industries. Larry spent most of his career at Cameron but moved to Lufkin in the early 90s. During my career transition, Larry allowed me to showcase my abilities while working as the scheduler/planner of the Pumping Unit Facility in Lufkin, Texas, and then moved me to west Texas to manage sales and business development. Larry was a strong mentor who allowed employees to do what was needed as long as the results came through in the end. By providing this freedom, I developed my talent for sales, operations, and growth in the Permian Basin while learning multiple forms of artificial lift and the benefits of automation in the field. Meadows: Early in my artificial lift career, a mentor taught me to look for the value of just one more run day to an operator. That person taught me to listen and work to shape a tailored solution around the customer’s needs—not just sell them widgets. That made me view technology and development differently by asking the right questions, focusing on the business case from end to end, and framing it in a real-world application to provide a disruptive solution. JPT: How have you seen knowledge sharing and best practices evolve within artificial lift applications over the years? Stephenson: Artificial lift has experienced a metamorphosis while I’ve been in the industry. During the early portion of my career, virtually every technical presentation on artificial lift was delivered at a non-SPE event. This meant that most knowledge sharing was via PowerPoint, and there was never an accompanying manuscript that might find its way into OnePetro or JPT. If you weren’t physically present in the room where the presentation was delivered, you had virtually no way to access the information being shared. That all changed with the creation of the SPE Artificial Lift Conference and Exhibition (ALCE) events in the Americas and the Middle East. These events were the brainchild of Shauna Noonan during her first term on the SPE Board of Directors. Those who work with artificial lift owe Shauna an enormous debt for this. When Shauna was the JPT technical editor for the topic she had relatively few papers to draw from. My job was significantly easier when I served in that role. The ALCE events and the ESP Symposium provided a wealth of papers from which to choose. The requirement to write a manuscript increased the technical rigor of these works and made them more useful to industry professionals. Romer: There are more avenues for sharing now, including SPE technical sections, SPE regional artificial lift conferences, the Artificial Lift Research and Development Council (ALRDC), and through joint industry projects like C-FER’s ESP Reliability Information and Failure Tracking System, LSU’s Gas Lift Valve Performance Clearinghouse, and the ALRDC’s Horizontal Well Downhole Dynamometer Data Acquisition Project. Internally, knowledge sharing has increased with virtual events with video. Unfortunately, this has made in-person events less likely. Labrador: Knowledge sharing has positively increased over the years. It is evident when you look back and see we have more events related to artificial lift systems and we recently got a specific SPE technical section for artificial lift (and gas well deliquification). The operators are working together to share the learning curve. Also, both operators and oilfield service (OFS) companies are documenting and publishing the lessons learned, best practices, and the knowledge acquired over time more frequently than before. Noonan: Initially, most artificial lift events were not SPE-organized events, and the presentations/papers were not publicly available. I made it my mission to change that when I joined the SPE Board as the Production & Operations Technical Director. I created new AL events, converted the SPE Gulf Coast Section ESP event to a symposium so papers could be formally published, advocated for the AL Tech Section, and created the Legends of Artificial Lift Awards. Jaua: Knowledge sharing has grown tremendously in the past 20 years, along with the evolution of digital technologies. In the ‘not that far’ past, we had to travel to congresses to meet peers and be exposed to newer technological developments. Nowadays, we have all the information and much more at the tip of our fingers and in every format we can imagine. From microlearning content to fully immersive technical conferences, all delivered remotely. In parallel, more communities and interest groups have been formed because now there are more domains and subdomains within the artificial lift space and, in general, in industry. Leslie: From personal experience, the oil field grows through knowledge sharing and best practices in all facets of the industry. In the artificial lift space, engineers and supply chain utilize their knowledge of products to secure better pricing and activity. In contrast, other OFS companies utilize knowledge sharing and best practices to produce wells at a higher volume with a better mean time between failures. By sharing the learned knowledge, the OFS and E&P companies can produce at a higher production level with fewer problems. Without knowledge sharing and best practices, today’s oil and gas market would be totally different. Meadows: Unlike in previous years, where the person who had the document in their filing cabinet was considered the expert, we now have multiple applications for data sharing on global internal operations that allow answers to pop up, lessons learned to be elevated quickly, and field instances to be shared and trended with actions. This allows us to help our customers with solutions gained from actual cases worldwide and to develop the best technologies to address their needs using real-time operational feedback. Eagerness to share, learn, and collaborate is a large part of our culture at Baker Hughes. Technology has allowed that to advance quickly in the artificial lift field and beyond. JPT: Is there a specific paper that helped you or your team solve a challenging problem in artificial lift? Could you elaborate on the problem and the solution? Stephenson: The paper that has specifically influenced my work the most in recent years is an old one: SPE 179, Evaluation of Valve Port Size, Surface Chokes, and Fluid Fall-Back in Intermittent Gas Lift Installations by Kermit Brown and Frank Jessen. This paper was published in March 1962, and more than 60 years later, it is still the most extensive exploration of intermittent gas-lift performance available to the industry. Brown explored the relationship between slug height, gas passage, surface opening pressure, and slug recovery in intermittent gas lift wells. This is particularly relevant today because the industry has thousands of wells in unconventional resource plays that produce via continuous flow gas lift and experience rapidly declining production rates in early life. As the wells mature, the artificial lift system becomes less efficient and requires some lift revision. One of the most likely is conversion to intermittent gas lift, often using a pilot valve. Unfortunately, the methods for designing and analyzing these wells are often antiquated and rely heavily on rules of thumb. The results can be unpredictable and/or suboptimal well performance. When I first read this paper, it inspired me to explore the issue further, ultimately leading me to Ali Hernandez’ textbook, Fundamentals of Gas Lift Engineering, published in 2016. Using the knowledge gained from Ali’s textbook and the original paper by Kermit Brown, I built an in-house simulator for intermittent gas lift wells. This work also inspired the formation of the newly created Texas Tech Gas Lift Consortium in Lubbock, Texas. Romer: We were looking for ways to improve gas lift and came across SPE 21639 (1991), Foamed Gas Lift, by M.G. Bernadiner from the University of Michigan. The project presented an interesting way to improve gas lift using surfactants, with both laboratory and oilfield experiments showing that it could be an effective means for producing oil from depleted reservoirs. We thought it could be an interesting way to improve gas lift, and it led to research testing at C-FER in Edmonton, a pilot in the Gulf of Mexico, a presentation at ALRDC, and later pilot testing and application in the Delaware and Midland basins. No SPE papers were written on the ExxonMobil project, but the original paper demonstrated how somebody had done it once and that it should work. Leslie: One of the most influential technical papers impacting my team and colleagues to solve the goal for lifting higher production with rod lift continues to be SPE 176041(2015), Electric Submersible Pumping Systems vs. Long-Stroke Pumping Units: A Case Study of Economic Comparison in a Low-Volume Well. The paper captures the topic of shifting to rod lift sooner by transitioning from an ESP to a long-stroke Rotaflex pumping unit and the benefit of saving workover costs while increasing production well above traditional beam pumping systems. The shift to rod lift sooner had been successful due to the long, slow stroke of the vertical system, allowing for increased pump fillage and higher production rates. In this case, the long-stroke system proved to reduce power costs by 37%, reduce workover costs by 91% and combined reduced opex by 62%, all while producing a fluid rate of 1,180 STB/D in either system. This has been a fantastic paper to show the benefits of transitioning to rod lift sooner with huge success. Meadows: Permanent magnet motors (PPM) are a step change in the ESP industry. They generate high torque on startup, are highly efficient, and have a wider operating range than traditional motors. However, they can generate electricity anytime fluid flows through the pump and forces system rotation, even when powered off, energizing the power cable to the surface. A major limitation to global field adoption is the danger of this hazardous back-EMF associated with motor rotation and energization during installation, retrieval, and workover operations. In response to this industrywide HSE problem, our team has developed the industry’s first engineered PMM safety barrier that prevents the ESP pump from spinning the PMM, eliminating voltage generation at the surface. We were excited to present this HSE innovation at the 2023 SPE Gulf Coast Section—Electric Submersible Pumps Symposium in SPE 214745, Permanent Magnet Motor Safety—The Big Short Question. JPT: How have advancements in technology impacted artificial lift? Are there any technologies that you find particularly promising for the future? Stephenson: Mostly, advancements in artificial lift technology have been incremental improvements. The most-used artificial lift methods have existed for decades or even longer. Technologies I think could make a difference include permanent magnet motors in ESP, sucker rod pump, and PCP installations, improved downhole gas separation and gas-handling devices, improved surveillance software, and the application of artificial intelligence/machine learning techniques. Romer: I see technology advancements have impacted artificial lift in several ways, including: Labrador: Artificial lift technology advances have allowed us to install and run the systems in more complex trajectory wells and produce them reliably. Additionally, it has allowed us to be aligned with the commitment to care for the environment. Also, AL technology has impacted the artificial lift world positively. Who could imagine we would have more efficient motors installed at the surface and the bottom of the well? Or that we could challenge the boundaries of each AL according to the needs of the field and sufficiently produce them? We must keep challenging our boundaries and making bigger efforts in this important part of the oil and gas industry. The relationship between OFS and E&P companies plays an important role: the operator’s needs and the service companies’ constant solutions to save on downtime and lost production. Noonan: Instrumentation advancements allowed us to understand the physics of how artificial lift systems work internally. Before, we didn’t have the advancements in instrumentation to put sensors inside the various pumps or lift systems to really measure and understand what was happening inside. It was always theories and rules of thumb. But once we understood the fundamentals of each basic lift system, we knew how to design it properly—whether it was how we sized it or the materials used—to ensure it was the right design for the right environment. Also, permanent magnet and linear motors will make an impact (extinction of the rod string). Jaua: We see the dramatic increase in lifting systems’ average run life and their survivability operating under extreme environments in the past 20 years; it is evident that technological advancements have had a huge impact on the artificial lift industry. Artificial lift systems are installed faster, safer, last longer, and operate in wells that were impossible to operate not long ago. All thanks to improved designs, advanced materials, and evolved processes and practices. The lifting system with the most promising growth potential is PCP, particularly the rodless version powered by downhole permanent magnet motors, which is more suitable for deviated wells. Current elastomer compositions and manufacturing processes prevent the PCPs from surviving temperatures above 200°F and produce fluids with high aromatics content, frequently found in lighter oils. New technologies and manufacturing processes are under development that will allow PCPs to perform in hotter wells and produce lighter oils. This will result in a viable alternative to efficiently producing wells, replacing rod lifting systems with a higher frequency of failures in deviated wells. Leslie: The artificial lift market continues to see new technology in many shapes and forms. Whether it is advancement in a long-stroke system, a beam pumping system, advancement in ESP technology, or advancement in downhole technology, there continue to be new developments and products every year. The one technology that continues to advance rapidly with huge impacts on field operations is the digital/automation space. The future of field operations will be centered around automation. The future will continue remote monitoring with autonomous control and failure prediction well ahead of where we are today. The autonomous field of the future will utilize sensors and monitors to detect failures before they happen, allowing operators to save on downtime and lost production. Digital integration and automation are the most impactful technologies for artificial lift in the future. JPT: What are the most pressing challenges and opportunities facing the artificial lift sector today? Stephenson: The most pressing challenges I see include the application of artificial lift in unconventional shale oil wells and in subsea/deepwater installations. Shale oil wells can be challenging to lift due to their high gas-to-liquid ratios, sand production, sharp production decline in early life, and horizontal well trajectory. All these issues can decrease equipment reliability and/or deferred production. Applying artificial lift systems in subsea installations can be challenging because of the high intervention costs associated with these wells. In a perfect world, we would like to install an artificial lift system in these applications that can survive for 10 years or more while boosting production. Romer: I see the most pressing challenges in the following areas: Labrador: The challenge will always be to be better than yesterday and to have better performance and efficiency in ALS equipment than the previous year. Reducing the carbon footprint through ALS is a commitment we all have right now for the planet and future generations. The opportunity is to continue developing technology to make artificial lift systems more efficient and cleaner for the environment. Moreover, digital integration and automation technologies will help us to impact the future for artificial lift. Also, being competitive in quality, performance, and price is something that can’t be left behind. Noonan: Advancements in manufacturing have not kept pace. Many facilities have old equipment and still rely on too much human interaction, which can lead to quality-assurance issues. The technical differentiation between vendors has shrunk, so the battle for business will rely on manufacturing, assembly, and service quality. Jaua: All oil wells eventually require artificial lift systems to produce, meaning millions of wells operating globally, requiring a constant power source available 24/7. This makes lifting systems one of the industry’s largest emitters of carbon dioxide. The greatest challenge will be the evolution of lift-system selection and sizing that puts efficiency levels as a top priority. It also represents an opportunity for those technology companies committed to developing new solutions to reduce their carbon footprint. Leslie: There are several key challenges facing the artificial lift sector today, including limited resources, the need for consolidation, and, most importantly, a consistent supply chain with minimal reductions in delivery. The oil and gas market has received a bad reputation as dirty and cyclical, driving young talent to avoid the industry. This reputation limits the amount of new talent in the industry, creating challenges for both E&P and OFS companies. We must find a way to recruit and retain talent better going forward. The artificial lift landscape has too many competitors. There is a major need for consolidation, ultimately benefiting the end user and OFS companies. Finally, most artificial lift market products are produced outside North America due to the high production cost and the demand for lower-cost products. This creates an incredible challenge for OFS companies to work diligently to find alternative countries and manufacturing centers to supply products to all customers in artificial lift. These three areas are just some of the critical challenges facing the ALS market today. Meadows: In terms of challenges facing the artificial lift sector today, the main concerns we continue to hear from our customers are centered around increasing the run life and reliability of ESP systems, reducing costs and downtime of artificial lift systems in general, and maximizing and optimizing production. Our customers all want to unlock the lowest-carbon, shortest-cycle barrels possible. To do this, they need a partner to help them better manage power consumption and costs and boost pump speeds and production. We all know new drilling is slowing down while the world’s energy demands grow. New energy sources can only pick up some of that demand, which means we’ll need to get better at getting more out of the reservoirs we’ve already drilled, and ESPs will be a critical part of that. JPT: Where will artificial lift applications be heading in the next decade? Are there any emerging trends or technologies that will shape the future? Stephenson: In the next decade, I expect to see a greater emphasis on Romer: I expect to see in the next decade Labrador: The technologies that allow us to produce complex wells efficiently and cleanly for the ecosystem will be what will govern the next decade. The world is changing, and we must change with it. Noonan: Material advancements will make all the difference. Rod strings will be obsolete. Jaua: I see artificial lift applications accelerating the adoption and implementation of artificial intelligence and machine learning solutions. For instance, until today, designing, selecting, and optimizing lifting systems required a technical staff to make and control decisions. It is already happening today—but not fully adopted—that machines are gathering and processing vast sources of historical data and, in seconds, without human interaction, selecting the best lifting system, sizing, and features required for every well. Allowing a fully autonomous operation and increased failure predictability levels make the entire operation more efficient. Digital solutions are still in the infant stages in the artificial lift sector, but without any doubt, they are destined to lead a more efficient and sustainable O&G industry. Leslie: The future for artificial lift will be centered around digital technology and operator energy consumption. The evolution of PMM will be significant for operating all artificial lift forms more safely and energy efficient. PMMs have already been installed on basically every form of lift today with much success, but adoption has been slow as operators are still in the testing phase. In addition, the digital space will bring new technology with capacitors and storage of excess energy to maximize efficiency and productivity in the field. These technologies are just arriving to the market and producing significant energy savings, and the future will only get better as we move forward with this new technology. Meadows: Automation simplifies decision-making. Digital will continue to shape the future by optimizing and increasing production. Variable speed drives (VSDs) will also play an important role in reducing power consumption. We’re testing a new VSD slated for release later this year to reduce power consumption by up to 20% over our most-efficient drive. A virtual VSD interface will also be integrated, enabling operators and service companies to adjust drive settings from anywhere in the world remotely. The switch from induction motors to PMMs is also where the future is headed. We want to ensure we’re positioned to ensure this happens as quickly and safely as possible, so we are excited to champion the industry’s first engineered PMM safety module. This new module prevents the ESP pump from spinning the PMM, eliminating voltage generation at the surface for safer, simpler operations.

,https://jpt.spe.org/artificial-lift-25-years-of-change-tracked-in-the-pages-of-jpt,"Nodding donkeys. Thirsty birds. Rocking horses. All are playful nicknames for the oil and gas icon known as a pumpjack. To the uninformed, the pumpjack is a thing-a-ma-jig that has something to do with oil, probably “fracking” because that’s what drilling rigs do, right? But as an industry-educated and well-informed reader of JPT, you know this is inaccurate. By whatever name you call it, you know that the pumpjack is the visible manifestation of an invisible physics equation, a mechanism buried deep underground that lifts reservoir fluids to the surface. You also know it is one type of artificial lift available in a stable of systems with equally curious and technical names like progressive cavity, plunger, jet, gas lift, and electrical submersible pump (ESP). While there is no global repository of artificial lift statistics, industry observers estimate that 90 to 95% of the world’s producing wells use artificial lift, as noted in a 2013 JPT story on the challenges and opportunities for artificial lift. Artificial lift, as applied in oil and gas production, has existed for over 100 years. A 2014 JPT story laid out a brief history of the practice,sharing how the walking beam principle dates back to at least 476 CE when used in Egypt, and evidence of the use of sucker rods to lift fluids has been excavated from the homes of wealthier families in the early days of the Roman Empire. Even as we leap forward to the modern-day application of artificial lift systems, many techniques and technologies resemble their original designs. How these systems are applied has changed, especially in the past decade-plus with the emergence of shale. As highlighted in a JPT story on the past 25 years of technology advances, the industry underwent a robust era of technology development in its rush to crack the shale development riddle. Since 1999, the industry also delivered a 36% increase in global supplies, as noted in this JPT story celebrating this industry’s biggest innovations. 1999 represents an interesting turning point in the industry’s technological journey. Also, it is the last time JPT editors took the opportunity to celebrate the publication as it turned 50 years old that year. What follows are a few highlights from JPT’s coverage of advances and changes made in artificial lift applications and practices over the past quarter century. Adaptation and Transformation A circular beauty is realized in studying the history of artificial lift. For example, its place in the pantheon of published papers dates to 1925, with its first paper on a technique that is still highly relevant almost 100 years after its publication. “The gas lift is able to raise more oil from a well than any kind of a pump. Wells pumping 300 or 400 bbl daily have been caused to produce more than 1,000 bbl per day by the gas lift without injury to the wells,” said R.P. McLaughlin in a short paper titled “The Gas Lift Method of Pumping Wells.” It is the oldest paper on artificial lift listed in OnePetro. There’s an old maxim about how those who do not study history are doomed to repeat it. This rings true, especially when paired with artificial lift expert—and self-professed ESP guy—Mike Berry’s comment in a 2017 Technology Focus overview in which he said, “As much as it pains me to admit it, by the book, gas lift should be the default lift method for shale wells.” And therein lies the circularity of artificial lift’s modern-day history. It is a space populated by innovators and tinkerers, by those that see failure as an opportunity to try again until the system works. A 2022 JPT story on the sector’s ability to adapt and then re-adapt to meet the changing demands of production touched on how adaptation and experimentation have created a new toolbox. “Ten years ago, you wouldn’t have seen much gas lift used in the Permian Basin. Old school, traditional methods of lift, like electrical submersible pumps or rod pumps, were used there then. Gas lift, progressing cavity pumps (PCPs), or some of the other traditional methods weren’t used because these types were not as familiar to operators. They went with what they knew,” said Shauna Noonan, 2020 SPE President and senior director of global supply chain initiatives and Fellow for Occidental Petroleum, in the article. Industry events like those sponsored by SPE and other technical groups have brought greater awareness to the industry of the different types of lift systems used across the globe. “By bringing all the lift types together, we can learn from one another and have more tools in our toolbox to choose from. We’re starting to see that change, especially in the growth of new wells where we’re picking the right lift method at the time, and not what they knew,” she said. “It’s an interesting time. All the gas-lift people that used to be in Louisiana working in the Gulf of Mexico are now in Midland,” Noonan added. “Gas lift is one of the fastest-growing lift methods out there, displacing the other types.” But gas lift didn’t get its start in the Cajun State. There’s a 1926 article available in OnePetro on its application in the Mid-Continent oil fields of Oklahoma. A contributor to this circularity was the limited avenues for knowledge sharing, as noted by a few in this article’s companion piece, “7 Industry Leaders Share Their Insights on the Past, Present, and Future of Artificial Lift.” Before 2014, when SPE held its first Artificial Lift Conference and Exhibition (ALCE) in Houston, most technical presentations were delivered at non-SPE events with no technical paper accompanying them, according to Greg Stephenson, chief production engineer for Occidental Petroleum. “If you weren’t physically present in the room where the presentation was delivered, you had virtually no way to access the information being shared,” he said, noting that the ALCE events in the Americas and Middle East, along with the ESP Symposium, have provided a wealth of papers to learn and build on. “The requirement to write a manuscript increased the technical rigor of these works and made them more useful to industry professionals,” Stephenson said. The 2024 edition of the ALCE–Americas will be held from 20–24 August in The Woodlands, Texas, with the theme ""Modern Artificial Lift—Adapting to a Changing Industry.” A quick check of the OnePetro database shows that in the 10 years from 1999 to 2009, 272 articles on artificial lift were published in JPT. That number grew 22% to 333 articles published between 2010 and 2020. There have been 86 articles published between 2021 and February. Look to those innovators who accentuated the positives of gas lift and plunger lift to create the gas-assisted plunger lift (GAPL) system. The evolution of hybrid systems built from gas-lift principles can easily be traced through the pages of OnePetro and JPT. In just one of many examples, a technical paper (SPE 48840) featured in a May 1999 Technology Focus shared how a gas-lift-jet-pump (GLJP) application delivered a significant production increase with the same gas-injection volume obtained in two wells during a test in a field located offshore Lake Maracaibo in Venezuela. The GLJP performed successfully when installed in a well containing sand with a high gas/oil ratio above the main liquid-producing zone, providing the capability to produce without surface gas injection. A technical paper (SPE 64466) featured in a May 2001 Technology Focus shared how an ESP and automated gas-lift completion was developed to overcome production challenges in the Stag field located offshore Dampier, Australia. The flow from the well's horizontal section had a high gas fraction, continuously slugged, and carried large sand volumes. And the reservoir pressure depleted more rapidly than expected. It has the hallmark challenges for shale production, begging whether something similar would work for shale. Maybe it has, but a paper has not been published in OnePetro or reported on in JPT. A check of OnePetro reveals that SPE 64466 has been cited in seven papers for conferences held in the Asia Pacific and Middle East regions. Artificial Lift Tech Snapshots Perhaps the only good thing to come out of a revolution is that people talk more. This was certainly the shale revolution's impact on artificial lift. Finding solutions to arrest the rapid decline in production was just one of many challenges the industry had to wrangle. Other issues, like gas and solids entering the wellbore and long, undulating lateral wellbores, also present pumping challenges. Add to this various business and operational goals, like minimizing capex, opex, and downtime while maximizing the well’s life and production output, the challenges of artificially lifting shale reservoirs are complex. Artificial lift experts warned about these challenges in a JPT story in 2015 regarding long-term production in horizontal wells. Many of these challenges remain in 2024. However, with more than 130,000 shale wells drilled and put into production in the major US basins, the industry is improving with the data and the knowledge of what will and will not work when applying artificial lift technologies. Fortunately, new technologies are making great inroads towards improving production. Improved sucker rod coatings, better downhole separation techniques, advances in data and automation, and increased use of permanent magnet motors are all making an impact. Improved Sucker Rods. A JPT story in November 2022 asks a question of change; namely, if a better sucker rod is built, will buyers be willing to change. Shale wells commonly produce corrosive fluids, paraffin, and asphaltenes. One example of a sucker rod improvement discussed in the story is a protective anodic coating for continuous sucker rods that prevents corrosion and reduces drag when the rod rubs against the surrounding tubing. The paper (SPE 209751) presented at the 2022 ALCE-Americas, highlights the ChampionX product which relies on a powdered metal coating that short-circuits electrochemical reactions that cause rapid corrosion. Better Downhole Separation. Addressing the challenge of gas and solids separation for sucker rod or ESP pumping, a relatively new design named the WhaleShark takes advantage of multiphase liquid flow reversals to ensure the pump remains full of liquid with every stroke while also protecting the pump from erratic load conditions. SPE 209755 was presented at the 2022 ALCE and featured in a JPT story in November 2022. The Oilfy product sits above the bend of the horizontal wellbore, in the vertical section. It uses an upward-facing, open-mouth collector intake that captures liquid that naturally falls backward due to gravity. To encourage more liquid fallback, the area above the collector is the gas separation region that has no annulus and uses an oval-shaped eccentric (on the side), rather than centric, pump intake tube designed to slow fluid velocities while improving liquid fallback downward into the collector. Advances in Data. Another of the significant advances in artificial lift is the increasing use of digital systems and automation to capture, compute, monitor, and react to well data. Regardless of the company's size, from supermajor to smaller privately held operators, these data are critical to operations, as noted in a January 2023 JPT article on how digitalization projects are delivering returns for operators. In it, a pair of Texas-based private operators shared how they apply data using Datagration’s PetroVisor to improve their artificial lift operations. Hess shared how it developed the digital twin of its Stampede production platform in the US Gulf of Mexico as part of a pilot project to enable process equipment condition monitoring on key topsides equipment. PMM. The growing adoption of permanent magnet motors (PMM) has played out on the pages of JPT, starting with a July 2009 article on their application in oil production. In it, the benefits and application of PMMs rather than asynchronous submersible electric motors used to drive ESPs at the time were discussed. PMMs in ESPs were just beginning to achieve wider application at the time. In the more than 10 years since the article, PMMs have entered various applications. A March 2023 JPT technical synopsis shared results of how PMMs were used to help reduce the carbon footprint in artificial lift systems used in Colombia. The operator installed and operated PMMs on ESPs, PCPs with an ESP PMM, PCP PMM, and sucker rod pump. The implementation of the PMM technology was successful, delivering power savings of more than 15% and lifting cost optimization. The energy-savings effect obtained by each system translated into a forecast reduction of 24,500 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent and aligned with the operator’s sustainability objectives. In February, Weatherford International confirmed it had successfully installed a PMM-powered reciprocating rod-lift system in the Bakken Shale as part of a seven-well pilot test for independent producer Chord Energy. The oilfield technology provider uses a PMM on its PCP systems. It said this installation is the first application of a PMM on a reciprocating rod-lift system in its North American operations. The past 25 years have demonstrated what Mauricio Prado, professor emeritus at The University of Tulsa, wrote in his May 2003 Artificial Lift Technology Overview that “this area, that a few years ago was seen as a mature one, is proving to still be a fertile place for innovation, research, and development.” While it is impossible to know what the next 25 years of artificial lift advances will look like, it will certainly continue to be an engaging space to watch and report on.

,https://jpt.spe.org/q-a-with-dennis-denney-jpt-technology-focus-creator,"In 1997, JPT debuted a monthly feature that represented an unconventional approach in meeting SPE’s goal of disseminating technical information to its members. Soon titled “Technology Focus,” the feature brought together subject-matter experts (SMEs) in a range of important industry topics to review technical-paper abstracts gathered from the previous year of SPE meetings, as well as the Offshore Technology Conference. Its architect, engineer, and pilot was Technology Editor Dennis Denney, who would become a familiar presence to SPE members and staff alike over a 17‑year career, although his industry roots extended to his college days. Dennis helped recruit SMEs for review service; sent them hundreds of abstracts and full papers (monthly, that is; the cumulative count of papers he handled is likely a six-digit figure); answered their questions and concerns with prompt, supportive guidance; and then, once papers had been selected, synopsized them for publication in the magazine with the longtime help of Assistant Technology Editor Karen Bybee. As this writer well knows, condensing a 10,000‑word paper on, say, distributed quasi-Newton derivative-free optimization methods for field development optimization into a 1,500‑word summary that captures the novelty and technical sophistication of its authors’ work can be a daunting task. Applying his own background as a petroleum engineer to methodically analyze and trim each chosen paper, Dennis did just that dozens of times a year, transforming these texts into svelte packages that included only one table or figure to deliver the highest possible quantity of quality to JPT readers. When Dennis retired in 2013, I initially split his eyebrow-raising workload with fellow Technology Editor Adam Wilson (now JPT’s Special Publications Editor). It was immediately clear from the way that reviewers spoke about Dennis, and his contributions to the magazine and SPE itself, that he was held in the same high regard outside of the organization as he was within it, a testament to the reputation he had earned while working with so many members and SMEs. It was entirely fitting that, for JPT’s 75th anniversary celebration, we caught up with Dennis to reflect on his achievements in the industry and with the groundbreaking Technology Focus feature he created. Dennis lives with his wife Linda in Rockwall, Texas—not too far from SPE headquarters in Dallas, but not too close, either!—enjoying his retirement and his family. (Note: For more on the development and history of the Technology Focus features, read the companion piece to this article, “Technology Focus Topics Reflect Industry Growth, Evolution Over 25+ Years.”) Why did you decide to go into the field of petroleum engineering? I worked several years as an engineering tech, testing gas wells, tracking well and reservoir pressures, and writing computer programs to analyze pressure data. The department manager encouraged me to finish my degree and become a petroleum engineer. So, after I received a scholarship from J. Harold Dunn (at age 28), my wife and I sold our house, packed our things into a U-Haul truck, and loaded two young kids into the car to move to Bryan/College Station to attend Texas A&M University. How did you come to join SPE? I joined SPE as a student when I enrolled in the petroleum engineering curriculum at Texas A&M University in 1974. All of the “PetE” students were highly encouraged to join SPE (after all, a student membership was free). How did your engineering background translate into an editorial job with SPE? I spent 20 years working as a reservoir engineer and production engineer for Mesa Petroleum and Maxus Energy and as a consultant. I happened upon a help-wanted ad looking for a petroleum engineer to work with JPT. It seemed like an interesting idea, and so I visited with Bill Pike, the managing editor, and found that the magazine wanted to publish Reader’s Digest-type condensed versions (1–2 pages) of papers presented at SPE conferences. I saw this task as an opportunity for me to pass along knowledge to fellow SPE members. What did you find SPE’s strengths to be? SPE’s strengths are in its members. Experienced members support young members in gaining knowledge to help prevent problems and improve efficiency in exploring, finding, drilling, and producing hydrocarbon energy for the world. Members all over the globe share ideas and information. This sharing happens at the many conferences and in presented technical papers. It happens in local section meetings. It happens in the synopsis publications. It happens in the SPE Connect communities. How did the idea of the Technology Focus feature come about? Was a reviewing body always part of the idea? JPT wanted to publish papers presented at conferences sooner than would be possible through the peer-review system of the time, which, in some cases, could take years to get published. An idea was developed to publish synopsis versions within a few months of presentation so that new technology could be shared faster. Initially, with the help of Karen Bybee (a part-time editor previously employed by Halliburton in their research facility), recent papers were reviewed for applicable content and a few were chosen for synopsis in JPT. Although all SPE members received a copy of JPT, very few people would actually read the complete technical papers included during that time. Most people read about member and section news and looked through upcoming events. The newly introduced synopses, on the other hand, became popular and the synopsis idea expanded from a half-dozen papers per issue covering two topics, to 16 papers in four topics per issue. The original editorial board of a few people evolved into a review board with an expert SPE member for each of the 48 feature topics in what became known as the Technology Focus feature. The expert reviewer selects recently presented papers to be published in each issue. What was initial feedback like to the Technology Focus feature? Initially, there was hesitation; many long-time members wanted only the peer-reviewed papers published. They believed that for JPT to be a true “journal,” it should publish only peer-reviewed papers. As more of the younger engineers found the synopsis publications, the process was accepted rapidly because they had time to read a one- or two-page version to understand the main points of the paper and envision an application of the technology to their situation. One of the most common comments was that young engineers have such a high demand of work tasks; they did not have time to read 15- to 20‑page full‑length papers. The next step was obtaining the full paper for details. With the development of SPE’s online library, we were able to provide a link to the full paper. A short time later, SPE members were able to obtain a free copy of the full paper which continues today. As the number of papers presented at SPE conferences and the Offshore Technology Conference grew from about 3,000 in 1996 to eventually more than 10,000 per year, we began including a list of other interesting papers that would expand the specific topics and ideas highlighted in the Technology Focus. What differences, if any, did you see in JPT’s role within the industry between your hire and your retirement? The main difference was transforming JPT from a desktop dust collector to a valuable source of technical information. When I started with JPT, only the peer-reviewed papers were included in the Transactions publication each year. One problem we had in the late 1990s was delivering JPT to members outside North America. Now that JPT is a digital publication, all members get access to the publication at the same time each month and to the JPT archive. Also, JPT technical articles are now included in SPE’s OnePetro online library for access to anyone around the world at any time. The Journal of Petroleum Technology, the Society of Petroleum Engineers’ flagship magazine, presents authoritative briefs and features on technology advancements in exploration and production, oil and gas industry issues, and news about SPE and its members.

,https://jpt.spe.org/new-year-marks-jpts-75th-anniversary,"We’re excited to begin the year with the commemoration of JPT’s 75th anniversary. This issue launches our special features dedicated to JPT’s reporting of technology and practices over the past 7½ decades. Emerging Technology Senior Editor Stephen Rassenfoss and Senior Technology Editor Trent Jacobs penned this month’s articles highlighting innovations in drilling, completions, and reservoir engineering. Each month, our editors will dive into the archives to round up milestones of industry advancements and achievements as reported in JPT. Since its inaugural issue in January 1949, JPT has remained true to its mission of reporting the technological and scientific learnings and advancements in the global oil and gas industry. Built upon a strong technical foundation, it continues to draw upon the expertise and knowledge of industry experts to disseminate up-to-date, relevant information to SPE members from all disciplines. JPT’s evolution began with The American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical, and Petroleum Engineers (AIME), founded in 1871 in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. It was one of the first national engineering societies established in the US. In subsequent years, AIME was joined by four other engineering founder societies—The American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (now the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers [IEEE]), the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), and the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE)—and formed the United Engineering Foundation. (US President Herbert Hoover, a mining engineer, served as AIME’s president in 1920.) As AIME itself continued to grow, it decentralized and formed four independently operated member societies: SME (Society for Mining, Metallurgy, and Exploration); TMS (The Minerals, Metals, and Materials Society); AIST (Association for Iron & Steel Technology); and SPE (Society of Petroleum Engineers). AIME had as part of its membership a small, but growing, number of petroleum engineers. These members had specific technological issues far removed from their peers in the older, more-established engineering disciplines. The AIME Petroleum Branch Executive Committee (whose members represented companies such as The Pure Oil Co., Dowell Inc., Humble Oil and Refining Co., and the Texas Co.) determined that the best way to meet this group’s needs was to develop a “publication so dominantly petroleum as to secure wide reader interest,” one that would “rapidly gain the respect of the industry.” Over the years, that goal was achieved. JPT came to be recognized worldwide as the source for authoritative technical information in the petroleum industry. JPT's first issue included four technical papers, one of which was “A Hydraulic Process for Increasing the Productivity of Wells.” The paper’s author, J.B. Clark, noted, “To date the process has been used in 32 jobs on 23 wells in 7 fields, resulting in a sustained increase in production in 11 wells.” The hydraulic fracturing techniques for well stimulation that he discussed have been responsible for the subsequent recovery of billions of barrels of oil. Also, bear in mind that the world’s total crude oil production in 1949 was about 3.8 billion bbl, less than the projected total US annual production in 2023—4.7 billion bbl. Other articles related to the oil and gas business were “Private Financing of Oil-Producing Properties” and “Middle Eastern Oil and Its Importance to the World.” Interestingly, although the content is outdated, both topics remain relevant today, 75 years later. Join us each month to explore our rich history and follow us on LinkedIn. All issues of JPT from 1949 to date are available in OnePetro. Even a cursory glance at the titles of the papers will show the remarkable evolution of technology over the years. We wish you the best in 2024, both in your professional and personal lives. The Journal of Petroleum Technology, the Society of Petroleum Engineers’ flagship magazine, presents authoritative briefs and features on technology advancements in exploration and production, oil and gas industry issues, and news about SPE and its members.

,https://jpt.spe.org/25-years-of-technology-as-reported-in-jpt,"The past 25 years marked the emergence of shale as the next frontier for oil and gas production, and JPT’s Houston office was right in the middle of it all. Credit for starting this disruptive change goes to George P. Mitchell who led a 17-year-long effort to extract gas from the ultratight rock in the Barnett formation. A JPT story described how this effort was finally looking like a significant, profitable business in 1998 when Mitchell Energy’s engineers turned to lower-cost slickwater fracturing in their vertical wells. The success of this trial-and-error engineering marathon drew little notice at the time. But that seed grew into a huge business based on technology that showed it was possible to profitably produce oil and gas from virtually impermeable rock using large-scale fracturing and ever-longer horizontal wells. In the coming decades this reverberated through drilling, fracturing, and reservoir engineering, disciplines whose physics-based view of the world could not predict how that would happen. As JPT’s staff grew with the addition of reporters covering emerging technology, there was no ignoring what was going on around us. The magazine highlighted futuristic reservoir monitoring ideas in Saudi Arabia and advances in deepwater technology in Brazil, but the booms and busts of this high-profile business that delivered more oil than profits kept changing in interesting ways. The first SPE Hydraulic Fracturing Technology Conference I covered in 2011 was amazing and puzzling to this technology novice. I wondered how they could create fractured areas that looked like shoe boxes. At an early show, a speaker advised those who believed that fracturing knowledge began with shale to look back further in OnePetro. One of those paper authors, then and now, is Dave Cramer, senior engineering fellow for ConocoPhillips, who began learning fracturing when he graduated from college with a business administration degree and got a job with Western Company of North America. The singular change over the past 25 years is how much fracturing has been scaled up. “It like a factory out there, and it was not a factory when we started,” he said. In the previous 25 years, fracturing experts were doing a lot of innovative things. He proudly remembers being involved in a job for Amoco where they pumped 600,000 gallons of gelled fluids and 1.3 million pounds of large-mesh sand into a 35-ft tight sandstone section of a well in the DJ Basin in Colorado. The morning he told that story he was evaluating a well completed in Canada where ConocoPhillips used slickwater to pump 970,000 pounds of sand per frac stage. In some ways the job in 1978 looms larger in his mind. The whole job was aimed at a single target and was sophisticated: They pumped five different fluid mixtures as the job progressed based on their lab testing and fracture modeling. While he thinks the technical skills of those fracturing tight rock back then are underestimated, wells now with laterals that are miles long and hundreds of clusters to stimulate are so much more complex, which has created an insatiable appetite for data by engineers continually feeling pressure for greater production and efficiency. “Diagnostics are a lot better. Back then the only thing available was treating pressure analysis,” he said. Now in addition to that there are multiple measures from fiber-optic cables, downhole images of perforations, microseismic, and multiple test sites evaluating the pros and cons of each of these diagnostic ingredients. To keep up with the scale and pace of the jobs, the hardware and methods used to deliver the supplies and do the fracturing have rapidly evolved. There are now ways to fracture multiple wells at the same time, digitally control fracturing, and use massive pumps in a push to cut emissions and costs by phasing out diesel-fueled pumps. After the 2014 oil price plunge, cost cutting became an obsession and engineers found cheaper alternatives. A decade ago, operators were willing to pay to import sand from Wisconsin based on how they measured the quality of the grains. Now much of what is used is mined nearby, virtually eliminating the cost of shipping, and these fine-grained substitutes seem good enough. “We tried junkier sand and saw little to no production loss,” Cramer said. While fracture modeling has gotten a lot more sophisticated, he said that testing by trial and error is needed because it is so hard to predict how a change will turn out when pumped into a formation. Progress will continue depending on those who say, “Let’s try it; it sounds crazy, but let’s see how the well produces.” What follows are highlights from JPT’s coverage of changes in fracturing, drilling, and reservoir engineering over the past 25 years. One vision of the future of the oil business in the late 1990s was a picture of the first driller’s cabins made by NOV. It was a big change from the days when drillers worked on the drilling floor with a hand on the brake handle. The display screens, joysticks, and high-performance chairs in the new drilling booths were all common sights outside drilling rigs. But this new command center was a sign that the digital world had begun to intrude on the largely hydraulics-based world of exploration and production. “Prior to my time in the industry the focus in drilling was on more muscle and working harder,” said Trey Mebane, who now advises startups. Since then, more muscle still matters, but so do the digital control systems and data flowing from them. He was one of the newcomers hired in the mid-1990s by NOV and other service companies to make that change. It needed his knowledge of computer science and technology commercialization to help it sell a new generation of equipment. Equipment providers had to turn to computer-based digital control systems used widely in industry when it was clear that the equipment on the next generation of offshore drilling rigs was too complex for traditional hydraulic control systems. When he asked a driller back then about the digital displays and the first-generation autodriller, he was told that was all fine. But the best thing was working while seated on the comfortable chair in a climate-controlled cabin. All it lacked was a cupholder—a problem that was soon fixed. And Then What was not obvious 25 years ago was how the digital data flow and processing power required to create this control system would eventually lead to programmable control systems that have changed the work of drilling engineers. By 2008, the digital generation in service companies and oil companies had created the SPE Drilling Systems Automation Technical Section with a goal of moving the industry toward the day when drilling rigs would be fully automated. At the time, the idea of pushing a button to drill a well sounded inevitable. That year, Helmerich & Payne (H&P) launched their long-term effort to gather and analyze data as the basis for innovative digital control systems. Years later they showed the value of that bet by doubling down to build a fleet of FlexRigs which offered both more brawn plus brains that reduced downtime for more efficient drilling. In 2018, after H&P bought the company that made the program, H&P took the next logical step—feeding those commands into the drilling control system for “factory-like consistency,” said John Lindsay. Innovative operators and service companies were focused on building the automated drilling rig of the future. The focus abruptly shifted after the 2014 oil price crash. Apache dropped its program to develop a fully automated rig. But not long after that, it began working on ways to drill better by making the most of data, software, and advanced statistical analysis. “We saw that there was at least a small opportunity to do something more with our rig data—that 1-Hz real-time data—by combining it and mashing it up with contextual data so that it could be something useful,” said Michael Behounek, the leader of the project who has since retired and is working as a consultant. In other words, they wanted to figure out how best to manage the job and ensure those procedures were followed. Traditionally the driller was more likely to be told: “There is your bit, go run it, and do your best. This is a vastly different thing,”said Fred Dupriest, a Texas A&M University professor. Increasingly, digital control systems on rigs make it possible to program in best practices to ensure they are followed. And the job of engineers is to look out for flaws in the system and fix them. Matt Isbell, drilling engineering advisor for Hess, likened its process improvement program to a battle of wits. He said, “People learn from that and it’s not too long before they have ideas that can be put into practice that can improve whatever the operation is,” in this story. Over 8 years, Apache’s drilling improvement methods delivered 10% year-over-year drilling costs savings and were used by rig crews on more than 1,700 wells in all sorts of plays. The probabilistic drilling advisor, though, has its limits. A paper describing the system said it “only enables the opportunity—it is the field personnel and engineers taking the proper actions and decisions offered by the system that deliver the improvement.” A JPT story in 2015 asked the question: What does a fracture look like? It was provoked by engineers and geoscientists who were irked by fracturing illustrations, like Norm Warpinski, a Halliburton fellow, who said, “They do not look like tree roots. Things do not shatter like glass and run in all directions.” Others also complained about fracturing illustrations that looked like lightning bolts or tree roots. While geologists pointed to natural models, Mike Smith, the founder and president of the fracturing consulting firm NSI Technologies, said, “My mental image varies by formation—by the geological environment. It depends on where you are.” He described the force of fracturing fluid interactions with a formation. “It goes to hit the first natural fracture and turns whichever way, then goes along until it hits another fracture, splits off again, and starts off across the country.” In the years since, there have been advances in finding ways to observe fracture growth, interactions, and how they change over time, including papers from a series of fracturing test sites. Based on those, an artist would surround the well with a massive number of fractures—most as thin as fine thread—with a few large cracks out further. On occasion a few of those can extend out thousands of feet. The shape of the fractured area is rarely symmetrical. Sometimes growth is blocked by sizable faults. A depleted zone around an old producing well will attract fractures, which may well hit the other well, reducing production for all the wells. Recent advances in stress monitoring can even track fracture growth. Patterns in the signal can define fracture development, which has proved more accurate than microseismic. In seems certain by now that fractures vary. Progress downhole has come from paying attention to details, often small ones, such as holes perforated in the casing for pressure pumping. When EV began imaging wells, early customers included fracturing experts such as Dave Cramer, a senior engineering fellow in completions for ConocoPhillips, who saw it as a way to directly observe where the water and sand they had pumped actually went. They expected to see differences based on previous research using fiber optics indicating the first perforations in a series encountered by the fluid resulted in big fracs, while later ones were hardly stimulated. Downhole images allowed engineers to see that in their wells. And eventually, as the technology improved, measurements could be made. That evidence led to a period of experimentation. Ultimately, that led to most operators choosing limited-entry methods to ensure all the perforation holes were stimulated. They focused on shooting uniform holes that limited flows to better distribute the water and sand based on plans to pump enough water and sand to stimulate all of them. Flows still vary, but paying attention to those holes has proven its value. For years, globs of black gum were flowing up from wells in Oklahoma, often clogging production equipment. The source of these “gummy bears” remained a mystery until a story 2020 reported on a paper by Mark Van Domelen, vice president for technology at Downhole Chemical Solutions. He identified the source: Iron-rich rock in the wells was interacting with high concentrations of certain types of friction reducers to create a rubbery polymer. The problem was the positive charge of the polymers added to fracturing fluid to reduce resistance and often to thicken it to allow it to transport more sand. When word got out in JPT, producers in other places noticed the problems. Buyers started advising customers to avoid formulations with a positive charge when reactive chemicals are present. It was a small problem for a huge industry, but it raised questions about other chemical reactions such as surfactants that quickly degrade in the ground or polymer gunk clogging fracture networks. George King, a petroleum engineering consultant, offered a possible root cause based on his experience teaching. “Damn friction reducers and iron! Engineers do not understand chemistry!” Some innovations sound crazy at the time, like the story about Shell drilling a horseshoe‑shaped well. Online mentions of the job initially sounded like something that a drilling engineer might have done on a dare. It turned out to be a way to drill a well under extreme circumstances. The horseshoe well filled a gap in a well pad after the planned vertical well for that lateral could not be drilled due to severe mud losses. They extended another well on the pad with a curving loop over the 5,000-ft-long path of the second lateral, and then fractured it. It was all done with off-the-shelf equipment. “What’s great about this well is not the fact that it’s new, novel, and innovative,” said David Gibson, cofounder and chief executive of drilling market research firm Gibson Reports, who followed the work. “It’s that it starts amazing conversations. Conversations about challenging the status quo—and given the current market and climate, we all need to follow Shell’s lead and think outside the box on all fronts.” In 2022, Nabors’ “fully automated” rig featuring an eye-catching robot on the floor handling drillpipe was contracted by ExxonMobil to see if it could outperform less‑sophisticated rigs. While the Pace-R801 was full of automated functions, “the robot is the one that gets most people interested and excited,” said Travis Purvis, senior vice president, global operations for Nabors Industries. The amazingly adept robot drew a lot of customer interest, but humans are generally still at the controls when it comes to moving pipe. At an IADC meeting, Paul Pastusek, drilling mechanics advisor for ExxonMobil, offered a simple explanation: “Humans can move really fast.” In the future drillers may be drilling laterals through granite to heat steam for geothermal power plants. If that proves to be true, they may be relying on methods for faster drilling developed more than 25 years ago by Fred Dupriest, who was then working for ExxonMobil. A story in JPT described how the method that allows drillers to effectively maximize their weight on bit to drill faster was used to drill through extremely hard, hot rock at a geothermal test site in Utah. The high cost of drilling in hard rock has inspired ideas that sound like science fiction, like plasma drilling. But the first steps toward building massive geologic heat-transfer systems will focus on off-the-shelf drilling and fracturing equipment. While Dupriest, who taught his method to drillers at the test site, acknowledged that progress is likely slower in what he described as “5,000 ft of kitchen countertop,” he added that “the types of issues that constrain the drill rate, and the way you deal with them, are no different.” A Chevron executive advised engineers at an SPE luncheon to avoid public displays of an Excel spreadsheet at work. The chief information officer for Chevron, Bill Braun, described it as “the new slide rule.” The line got a laugh, but he was serious. Like slide rules in the 1970s when scientific calculators came along, the venerable database tool from Microsoft is not keeping up with a business where the data sets have gotten too large for it to handle and are likely to reside on the cloud. At the time of that 2020 speech, other programs offered heavy data management abilities as well as better collaboration tools. It came at a time when engineers in college were feeling the need to upgrade their programming and data analysis skills to compete in a job market where operators were paying close attention to digital kills. Now, there’s another generation of AI programs built around using spoken languages, which can respond to requests, including writing code, which again raises questions about what engineers need to know about digital. The Journal of Petroleum Technology, the Society of Petroleum Engineers’ flagship magazine, presents authoritative briefs and features on technology advancements in exploration and production, oil and gas industry issues, and news about SPE and its members.

,https://jpt.spe.org/a-milleniums-worth-of-good-ideas-celebrating-10-of-the-biggest-upstream-innovations-since-1999,"You’ve read it in the editorials of JPT or heard it preached from the podium at one of the industry’s technical conferences over the years: The oil and gas industry is notoriously slow to innovate and adopt new technologies. But what if it just wasn’t so? Since 1999, the slow-moving oil and gas industry has only managed to push the needle from 75 million B/D to more than 102 million B/D—a remarkable 36% increase in global supply. This growth came in spite of what turned out to be fairly valid concerns openly expressed by many a quarter century ago that all the so-called “easy oil” had been discovered. Much of the world’s new supply indeed flows out from complex and/or difficult-to-access reservoirs that in 1999 were far from the minds of most. This includes the rise of the North America’s tight oil and gas plays, the deepwater sector, and a myriad of other megaprojects from Sakhalin to Kashagan to Manifa that have each pushed the petroleum engineering envelope to new limits. This is to say that the year 1999 represents an interesting turning point in the industry’s technological journey. It was a time when industry professionals, along with the rest of the word, were wondering what changes a new millennium would bring. As it turned out, many of the key technologies that made the aforementioned developments and others possible were just emerging in 1999 but the impact they would soon have was hardly clear. 1999 is also a useful signpost because odds are, the time that has passed since represents the majority or the entirety of your career—this is your defining era. According to our data, the average age of SPE membership in 2022 was 48. This would make the average member a 24-year-old back in 1999 which suggests that most of those reading this were at that point still in petroleum engineering school or just getting their feet wet in the industry. It’s also the case that 1999 was the last time JPT editors took the opportunity to celebrate the publication as it turned 50 years old that year. Now, as JPT welcomes its 75th anniversary, we are once again reflecting on the progress that’s filled the pages of this publication. As I thought of ways to commemorate the moment, one of the ideas that came to mind was a list of the most impactful technological developments to arise since our last big birthday bash. To keep the exercise focused I considered only those technologies which have led to some significant change in the core disciplines of drilling, completions, and reservoir engineering. Lists are nothing new to us and, in fact, my late father penned one several years ago for JPT. Steve Jacobs, an offshore roughneck turned oilfield entrepreneur and lifetime SPE member, acknowledged that list making is a tricky business in a guest editorial written about his top 10 all-time great oilfield technologies back in 2010. His way of measuring a technology’s impact boiled down to how hard it would be for the industry to live without it. The biggest pitfall of the exercise, though, is that there are always a few technologies left off that warrant reconsideration. “But,” as my father wrote, “that is the fun of compiling such a list—discussing and arguing which ‘players’ should make such an all-star, all‑time ‘team.’” With that, and in no particular order, I present my selection of the top 10 technological breakthroughs of the past quarter century. This will not be a surprise, but no list of this sort would be complete without paying homage to the tandem of multistage hydraulic fracturing and horizontal wells. Major credit is owed to the technology for reversing the decline in US oil production and propelling it from 5.9 million B/D in 1999 to almost 13 million B/D today—not to mention its contribution to making the US the world’s top gas producer. The unprecedented growth in unconventional oil and gas production that began in the US has since spread well beyond and today includes major tight-oil and (mostly) tight-gas projects of various maturities across Canada, Argentina, China, and Saudi Arabia. It must also be mentioned that the advent of modern hydraulic fracturing has led to a Cambrian explosion in surface and subsurface technologies—all designed to scale and improve the practice. Suffice to say, the completions sector has witnessed the most transformation among all of the industry’s major engineering disciplines in the past 25 years. The growth of the deepwater sector is among the most impressive aspects of the past 25 years. In 1999, with the future of this sector still not guaranteed, deepwater production in the US Gulf of Mexico surpassed that of the shallower shelf projects and never looked back. The limits of technology back then meant wells could only be drilled in water depths of around 6,000 ft—now considered by some to be the threshold of “ultra deepwater”—whereas today’s most capable assets can drill in waters twice as deep and expectations are that 13,000-ft drilling depths will soon become possible. Many key advancements have made this possible including everything from the design of drillships and semisubmersibles to new subsea electronics, blowout preventers, and an innumerable cast of other high-pressure/high-temperature technologies. While still holding a relatively small share of global production at around 6% in 2022, the deepwater sector is poised for continual growth this decade and, according to some projections, may exceed 17 million BOE/D of production by 2030. The advance of this technology arena is one that many were calling back in 1999 and we think the prognosticators of the past are owed credit, albeit progress has been less linear than most expected. The ultracompact, robot-like “rig of the future” that some saw coming and hoped to bring to market never fully materialized. The industry has instead witnessed a gradual shift towards integrating advanced automation software with existing rig technologies and control systems. Led by a global cadre of passionate experts, the result is a nuanced but ever-improving form of automation. With some prototype exceptions, the modern rig is considered a partially automated, highly monitored machine but in most cases human oversight is still playing a crucial role. This may fall short of the grand vision, but early adopters of even basic elements of automation have shown that the technology shaves days and many millions off drilling campaigns. Furthermore, this space appears to be maturing as it delivers higher orders of automation with each passing year. While many people foresaw the rising importance of downhole sensor technology in 1999, not many were referring to fiber-optic cables which have mainly been used to detect sounds (acoustics) and temperatures that can be deciphered into key diagnostic points. Uptake for downhole fiber optics has largely been driven by the North American unconventional sector which has come to rely on it for high-resolution visualizations of fracture dynamics. The data has revealed with stunning precision how fractures often grow hundreds of feet above a well or intersect with adjacent wellbores during frac hits. The adoption of fiber optics has helped calibrate fracture and reservoir models while displacing the use of legacy technologies such as microseismic surveys. The emergence of disposable fiber has further lowered the cost barrier and operational complexities. We are also seeing the use cases for fiber expand into production profiling, leak detection, and it may be possible to use fiber strain data as a proxy for downhole pressure. All of this only points to the continued adoption and innovation of fiber technology. Advancements made in 3D seismic acquisition and imaging have directly led to major offshore discoveries around the world. This includes Brazil’s pre-salt reservoirs which were not discovered until 2006. Today, these projects represent most of Brazil’s 3.5 million B/D—barrels that would likely never have seen the light of day without a series of critical improvements. From multi-azimuth surveys to wide-azimuth and eventually full-azimuth surveys, these developments have allowed operators to overcome many of the biggest challenges associated with imaging complex geologies. Many other newer discoveries are owed to the combination of advanced algorithms and computing technologies that by the end of the past decade achieved a massive milestone for the sector by drastically reducing the time it takes to process seismic data from many months to a few weeks or days. We’ve also seen 4D seismic using ocean-bottom nodes deliver massive value to large offshore projects by revealing the shifting profile of reservoirs as they are produced year after year. The latest iteration of the 4D concept has led to permanent reservoir monitoring (PRM) which involves laying hundreds of miles of fiber-optic cable and acoustic receivers on the seabed—making them the industry’s largest data acquisition systems. Among the many developments to emerge from the rise of modern hydraulic fracturing is a step change in fracture modeling. The impact of this development is hard to quantify but it has enabled the sector move beyond the constraints imposed by software codes originally designed with conventional rocks in mind. The shale revolution was launched using software that predicted symmetric bi-wing fractures that proved to be too simplistic to rely upon. By contrast, the latest generation of models account for far more geologic and geomechanical complexity to simulate fracture networks that are more realistic. And as the models have improved and become more believable, they have enhanced the value operators see in running data acquisition and diagnostics programs which creates a positive feedback loop that further enhances model accuracy. As a result, we have seen more and more operators point to calibrated model results as major drivers of decisions such as well placement, well spacing, and total well count per section—all huge determinants of a project’s outcome. Introduced to the oil and gas industry in the late 1990s, uptake of RSS was hampered by reliability issues. The industry has largely conquered its growing pains, however, and the technology is advancing along with the wider trend of automation in drilling. While used in the vast majority of offshore drilling campaigns, perhaps the most significant area of adoption for this technology has been in the onshore horizontal drilling sector in North America where RSS has struggled to shed its reputation as a nonessential luxury. However, thanks to cost reductions and improvements in the technology, RSS has increasingly displaced the use of conventional directional assemblies and is estimated to be used in about 30% of new wells in the onshore US arena. The embrace of RSS by both onshore and offshore drillers has been a key enabler behind remote directional drilling operations that allow a single driller in an office to oversee operations on multiple rigs at a time. RSS is also considered a critical component to furthering automated drilling efforts. The words “more sand and water” could sum up one of the biggest advances made by the unconventional sector in its effort to increase productivity. But maybe what we should really be celebrating is the science that’s gone into making better perforations which drink in all those super-sized volumes of sand and water. Improvements include more reliable and effective “perf guns” and shape charges but the advances go beyond the tools themselves. Intense industry efforts over the past decade have enabled operators to identify the optimal parameters regarding perf size, orientation, and the number of perfs per fracture stage. These are all understood today as critical factors that can decide the fate of a well and as a result have led to the embrace of concepts like the limited and “extreme-limited” entry which increase perforation efficiency and overall production. There are few things more critical to success in this business than understanding the rock that you are drilling into. On this front we have seen a number of notable developments that span both the relatively low-cost thresholds of the onshore market and the high stakes of the offshore sector. This includes the adoption of microfluidic technologies that have developed into faster and improved pressure/volume/temperature (PVT) analysis which is viewed as critical to predicting long-term reservoir performance. Geochemistry has enjoyed a revived interest in the onshore unconventional sector as a way to determine which layers of shale-rock oil and gas are actually being produced from, which aids with well spacing. Other recent breakthroughs include machine learning models that can predict gas/oil ratios in real time based on mud gas returns which is an innovation used mostly offshore today. Bleeding-edge research may soon make it possible to use drill cuttings to access reservoir fluid properties—a breakthrough that would open the door for PVT analysis on every single well. One technology that quite literally embodies the industry’s ability to push the limit is extended-reach drilling (ERD) which is often used as a way to access offshore reserves from an onshore drilling site. The complex and costly method is for many synonymous with ExxonMobil’s and Rosneft’s now severed joint venture at Sakhalin Island. The project began claiming world records in 2007 with the drilling of a 7-mile-long well. Several more would follow including a 9.3-mile-long well drilled in 2017. The ERD techniques pioneered in Russia’s Far East have now been embraced in the Middle East, especially in Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. In 2022, UAE’s ADNOC set a new ERD record with a 50,000-ft (9.4-mile) well, exceeding the Sakhalin record by 787 ft. Drilled from an artificial island, the well was the result of many technological advances coming together including gyro-equipped RSS, geosteering, high-speed measurement while drilling, advanced logging while drilling, vibration sensors that protect bottomhole assemblies, batteries that last for almost 3 weeks, and limited-entry stimulation techniques. There you have it. I believe that the industry would find it very difficult to maintain global supply or add to it going forward without each of these areas of advancement. And as the prognosticators that came before me have done, I wonder what will be on such a list in another 25 years. I imagine that by then AI will have matured to become an inextricable contributor to all areas of the business. Other promising developments that appear to just be getting underway include megascale carbon sequestration, enhanced geothermal systems, direct lithium extraction from oilfield brine, and the introduction of oilfield robots that will displace the need for human field operators. And of course, there is likely to be a breakthrough or two that none of us are able to foresee in 2024.

,https://jpt.spe.org/technology-focus-topics-reflect-industry-growth-evolution-over-25-years,"No matter your field of expertise or geographical area of operations, JPT’s Technology Focus feature addresses your career and research paths. During the more than 25 years of its appearance in the magazine, the feature has presented synopses of important papers in summarized form. A review of the Technology Focus topical calendar through the years reflects milestones in industry developments and innovations, and the magazine’s ability to adapt to meet the needs of its readers. Indeed, the inception of the feature was a response to such a challenge. Each year, thousands of high-quality technical papers are presented at SPE conferences and the Offshore Technology Conference (OTC). These papers are the embodiment of SPE’s mission to collect, disseminate, and exchange technical knowledge about the world of upstream E&P. In the late 1990s, JPT staff recognized a need to expand the intersection of SPE’s members with the crucial work outlined in the technical papers written by their colleagues. While SPE’s stable of peer-reviewed journals had always played a critical role in its mission, the rigorous review structure meant that these papers, published in full, might not see audiences for some time. Annual proceedings volumes collected the year’s research literature, but time constraints also limited the number of members who could explore these publications. The solution was the Technology Focus feature, in which conference papers dedicated to a broad spectrum of industry topics were chosen by subject-matter experts and condensed by SPE staff to convey key findings and illustrative case studies. The Tech Focus concept meant that SPE readers could find the best research and industry innovation at their fingertips each month. These papers were not peer reviewed, but the members of the JPT Editorial Review Board charged with their selection were recognized experts who reviewed hundreds of abstracts in order to choose only a few papers for inclusion. Since the feature’s launch, hundreds of SPE members from a wide range of major operators, service companies, technology specialists, academic institutions, and research facilities have served as reviewers. Tech Focus’ first decade-plus of publication, from 1997 through 2010, established and refined the pattern by which tech papers were selected, synopsized, and organized for presentation. Before 1997, JPT had run Technology Briefs that had the same idea, but these were irregular, applied only to tech papers with a length that would make publication in JPT impractical. For the first couple of years of the Tech Focus, however, each issue of JPT contained between two and three topical groupings of synopsized papers. The initial topics were broad, familiar ones (EOR, Drilling Technology, Fracturing, Offshore Development, Stimulation, and Reservoir Management, for example) as JPT Technology Editor Dennis Denney, who was responsible for the development of the feature, tested the waters and built a review board of industry volunteers to assist with the task of reviewing abstracts, reading full papers of interest, and selecting papers for synopsis. For the first few issues, JPT staff wrote a short introductory column for each topic, though by the end of 1997 the reviewers were writing that introduction, detailing the state of the topic and offering insight into their selections. Industry professionals have lived, much less grown familiar with, the cliché of things remaining the same the more they change. An excerpt from the April 1997 introductory column of then-Statoil’s Svein Tollefsen, reviewer for the topic of Offshore Drilling and Production, illustrates this truth: “We must face higher risks and tighter budgets while the same profitability requirements remain.” If that sounds familiar, however, so does his note that “What was previously considered impossible is suddenly possible,” illustrating the importance of the synopsized papers that followed in keeping members abreast of constantly evolving upstream technology developments. As the aughts passed, the number of Technology Focus topics appearing each month expanded quickly. By 2002, they had grown to 36 topics spread over the calendar, with each issue offering at least nine synopses in total. This expansion reflected the growth of the E&P industry into the reality of more-challenging hydrocarbon exploitation, as topics such as Reservoir Visualization, Extended-Reach Drilling, Tertiary Recovery, Intelligent Systems, and Tight Reservoirs made their debut. The reviewing body, soon known as the Editorial Review Committee—it would eventually become a Board, a designation it holds at the time of writing—also expanded, with a reviewer assuming selection duties of each featured topic. The Deepwater Horizon tragedy, and its subsequent effects on the whole of the oil and gas industry, can be used as another temporal marker for the development of Tech Focus topics in the period from 2010 to roughly 2017. While Health, Safety, and Environment had made its debut as a topic years before, its offering in the August issue expanded to include six synopses rather than the usual two or three. In his 2010 column for HSE, reviewer Emmanuel Garland of Total pointed out that many papers in the discipline had begun to “address general issues, developing ideas or concepts, and fewer deal with true technology. While there are good reasons for this trend, the industry must not underestimate the importance of technology development to reach our goal.” The heightened need for a sense of social responsibility demanded, simultaneously, a higher view and a dedication to operations-level technological detail that would allow goals of safety and sustainability—an addition to the industry lexicon that quickly became one of its pillars—to be achieved. More papers on well control and integrity began to appear even in other topics, and Decommissioning and Water Management were added to the topical calendar. Also growing in importance and frequency during this period were selected papers concerned with CO2 and its use and impact within, and outside of, the industry; while related to the broader topic of HSE, the topic demanded its own dedicated allotment of the magazine’s pages. CO2 Applications had been added to the calendar in 2008, but in the years that followed, papers in a wide range of topics were aimed at carbon-footprint reduction and, increasingly, carbon sequestration. Another important topical shift in this period came in 2013, with the retitling of the Knowledge Management and Training topic to Data Management and Communication. While the selected papers that year remained geared toward training of, and engagement with, the next generation of industry professionals, the change in the title reflected a growing awareness that “data,” long a lexical umbrella, was assuming a new meaning and importance within the world of E&P. Eventually, data-related topics would multiply, with the emphasis shifting from training—a subject taken on by other JPT features in print and online—to the acquisition, analysis, and application of data from a myriad of technologically advanced sources. A third demarcation in the feature’s development can be identified in 2018, as awareness grew that JPT would soon require a substantial online presence. The feature calendar had been fine-tuned most years, but a comprehensive discussion involving JPT staff and the review board arrived at a number of changes that year to both align features more closely with their corresponding conferences and introduce, rename, or sunset topics that had fallen out of step with industry momentum. Trialed and later renamed was the topic New Frontier Reservoirs, an acknowledgement of the fact that unconventional resources such as shale and tight gas had grown past that label. The following year, the decision was made to introduce Digital Data Acquisition, another dedicated data-related topic to join Data Analytics and Drilling Automation and Innovation. It would not be long, however, before the importance of “big data” to virtually every Tech Focus topic became evident. Intelligent Fields had meanwhile become Intelligent Operations, as the scope of the “digital oil field” grew to encompass the entirety of the E&P world. This shift, the most topically significant one of the past decade, will continue to shape the Tech Focus calendar well into the future. It should be pointed out that, no matter the industry interest in a particular topic, a dearth of conference papers on that subject means that it will not work for Tech Focus. For instance, during the most recent period discussed in this article, Decommissioning and Nanotechnology—both topics that, anyone would agree, are critical to the industry—did not survive within the topical calendar because there simply were not enough papers to sustain them. This underlines the fact that, while this feature will always be reactive to, and proactive with, industry trends, its lifeblood is the SPE or OTC conference paper. Any hyperbole one might apply in describing 2020 would be justified. As the world struggled with the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting upheaval felt by every layer of society and commerce, JPT transitioned to, first, a combined print-and-digital, and then all-digital, publication format. The difficult choice to go paperless was but one facet of SPE’s strategy to endure the economic instability that rocked the industry while still providing value, and a professional advantage, to its members. The Tech Focus feature, however, thanks to the dedicated work of its reviewers at an extremely demanding time that saw several of them coping with layoffs, corporate restructuring, and personal crises, did not miss an issue. As conference attendance recovered in 2022 and 2023, the availability of high-quality technical papers increased once more. Currently, 48 reviewers serve on the JPT Editorial Review Board, reviewing an annual cumulative average of over 5,000 abstracts as they carry out the mission of identifying the latest and best papers for JPT’s readers. The Tech Focus papers remain among the most-valued and most-read offerings in the magazine, maintaining the magazine’s standard as a golden one within the industry.

Is There a Hydraulic Fracturing ‘Blind Spot’ in Conventional Reservoirs?,https://jpt.spe.org/is-there-a-hydraulic-fracturing-blind-spot-in-conventional-reservoirs-restricted,"Almost all notable advancements in hydraulic fracturing technology over the past 2 decades have stemmed from the rise of the tight-oil and -gas industry. During this time, completions equipment evolved from the analog workhorses of yesteryear into increasingly sophisticated, digitized, and efficient machines that rival anything found in the oilfield technology portfolio. The transformation also includes mountains of scientific research that have enabled engineers and specialists to model and stimulate tight reservoirs with greater confidence and accuracy. But amid all this success, a question has been brewing for years: Can modern fracturing technology be effectively applied beyond the tightest, lowest-quality rocks? Martin Rylance and a team of completions experts from independent oil producer Liberty Resources and modeling firm ResFrac Corp. argue that the industry has developed a “blind spot” when it comes to low—but not ultralow—permeability conventional reservoirs. They believe these formations could be effectively developed using modern fracturing techniques, but they have largely been overlooked. According to Rylance, industry veteran and managing director of IXL Oilfield Consulting, this blind spot exists because North American onshore operators became focused on fracturing hard, tight rock in the 1970s and 1980s with fractured vertical wells. “We skipped a step,” Rylance explained.

Halliburton Debuts Automated Fracturing Tech in US Shale Fields,https://jpt.spe.org/halliburton-debuts-automated-fracturing-tech-in-us-shale-fields-restricted,"Over the years, fracturing operations have undergone a major overhaul. Sites that once had single wells now feature advanced configurations such as zipper fracs, simulfracs, trimulfracs, and even quadfracs. Combined with 24-hour pumping, the complexity of this work has increased substantially. “We’re at the end of what’s capable for one individual to handle,” said Shawn Stasiuk, vice president for production enhancement for Halliburton, which has recently debuted an innovation it calls the “Octiv Auto Frac.” The service company’s automated hydraulic fracturing technology suite includes its latest line of advanced pumping units along with its fracturing software and monitoring platforms. In January, as part of a collaboration with Permian Basin independent producer Coterra Energy, Halliburton announced the first fully automated hydraulic fracturing program. It allows for remote control and execution of fracturing designs with the push of a button. The initial rollout with Coterra resulted in a 17% increase in stage efficiency.

Vaca Muerta Shale Drives Argentina’s LNG Export Ambitions,https://jpt.spe.org/vaca-muerta-shale-drives-argentinas-lng-export-ambitions-restricted,"Shell’s entry into a project development agreement (PDA) with Argentina’s state-owned oil and gas producer YPF to initiate Phase 1 of the Argentina LNG export facility may have just reset the debate over whether Buenos Aires can reap the benefits hidden in its vast shale reserves. The facility proposed for construction at Sierra Grande, Río Negro, on Argentina’s Atlantic coast, is intended to use dedicated blocks in the Vaca Muerta shale formation in western Neuquén Province whose gas reserves rank as the second-largest technically recoverable shale gas resources globally. The US Energy Information Administration estimates 308 Tcf, located in approximately 30,000 km2. The PDA to jump-start the $50 billion Argentina LNG project obligates Shell and YPF to collaborate on pre-front-end engineering and design (FEED) activities until a decision is taken on FEED, YPF said in a press statement in late December 2024. Phase 1 envisions deployment of two FLNG units with a combined production capacity of 10 mtpa. Construction of onshore facilities would follow in Phase 2 and 3, raising total capacity to 30 mtpa with gas reaching the liquefaction facility via 580 km of dedicated pipelines, YPF said. But Argentina LNG isn’t alone. Two other LNG liquefaction and export options are also now under study as Argentina seeks energy independence and a piece of global LNG revenues in the 2030s and beyond with projects driven by Buenos Aries’ new Basis Law which incentivizes investments to construct pipelines and export terminals associated with Vaca Muerta. Projects exceeding $200 million are guaranteed 30 years of legal and regulatory stability if 40% of the investment is made within the first 2 years; projects over $1 billion are eligible for tax breaks including export and import tax exemptions.

Solving the Riddle of Aging Iron,https://jpt.spe.org/solving-the-riddle-of-aging-iron-restricted,"The debate over offshore decommissioning is almost as old as the first ever offshore platform—if you’re going to install it, you will need a plan to remove it once its work is done. Decommissioning liabilities have historically been the responsibility of the facility’s operator. However, sometimes iron outlives its owner. A bankruptcy or merger (or multiple) can and have muddied the waters of just who is responsible for removing a structure once it is beyond its useful life. If there is no traceable line of ownership once the operator is gone, the responsibility can fall to the host government.

SPE Membership From 1957 to the Present,https://jpt.spe.org/spe-membership-from-1957-to-the-present,"This is my sixth JPT column as 2025 SPE President. Hopefully, it will be the last excessively long one. So far, I have tried—as extensively and neutrally as possible—to share my perspectives on the realities (and most often, the challenges) that we face in SPE: energy transition, finances, governance, quality, and now membership. Our “SPE reality” is both complex and multidimensional, with these dimensions being interconnected and not to be addressed separately. The most obvious connections are SPE’s financial constraints and the costs that occur when solving individual problems, particularly when trying to do so in isolation. As an organization, SPE needs to balance its resources and actions—and frankly, we need additional sources of revenue to address all these challenges in parallel. However, these are not the only complexities. SPE also faces many issues on which our membership holds diverse and potentially conflicting opinions (e.g., energy transition, governance, and publication quality). We are a point where even stating an issue may be considered provocative (e.g., the “SPE” name, Society of Petroleum Engineers). Even attempting to propose a neutral position on topics outside our mission may not be acceptable to the most opinionated individuals on both sides of a particular issue. In such circumstances, it is very tempting to put some matters in the ‘much-too-difficult’ bin, but in reality, putting our heads in the sand is not an option. This is generally true (i.e., our industry is too critical, we cannot defer/deflect difficult issues), but especially relevant now, as converging challenges and competing risks affect our industry. With those conditions in mind, let me return to this month’s focus: the evolution of SPE membership. Recent Challenges Related to the 2015 Downturn and the 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic SPE’s membership statistics are summarized in Table 1. In the recent past, between 2015 and 2021, SPE lost one-third of its professional members (dropping from 99,000 to 66,000). Professional membership has somewhat stabilized now. In addition, we lost 14% of our student membership. Fortunately, SPE student membership has grown significantly since 2021, approaching 2015 numbers. The statistics in Table 1 are not great, but neither are these numbers particularly alarming. In aggregate, our SPE membership is down, but our current membership is above the 2008 level and stable. Our main concern at present is the demographics of this membership, especially the low number of young professional (YP) members. This scenario can (and will) lead to serious issues in the decades to come, much like the demographic gap we experienced following the 1985 downturn. I could focus solely on the YP problem—this would shorten this column, to the delight of the reader and our JPT publication staff. Instead, I will provide some historical context for our membership statistics. What we face today is not the first time, although it may be, statistically, the worst of times. A large proportion of the “downturn” events occurred during my career, and I will take the risk of adding my personal perspectives. You are welcome to skip these if you wish to stick to membership statistics, but I will make several attempts at entertaining you with my own experiences and perspectives. Global Historical Perspective of SPE Membership Let’s first revisit the evolution of SPE membership since its founding in 1957 when SPE became an independent entity, and our numbers began from there. I will then relate our SPE membership statistics to the major geopolitical events that strongly affected (if not dominated) our membership numbers. Let us begin with a visualization of professional and student SPE membership since 1960 (Fig. 1). Note that we are missing data for 3 years (1957–1960). While these data would have been helpful, there is not much to be learned from the 1957–1960 membership statistics, particularly in a modern context. This evolution cannot be separated from the geopolitical context and the fluctuation of crude oil prices, as shown in Fig. 2 (both with and without correcting for inflation in current US dollars). The cyclicity of the oil prices is always noted in such discussions, but we will focus our discussions on the following: (1) the 1970s geopolitical oil crises; (2) the 1985 downturn; (3) the 2008 financial crisis; (4) the 2015 downturn; and (5) the 2020 pandemic. From 1957 to the First 1985 Downturn In 1960, SPE professional membership was approximately 14,000, mostly US-based members (we will look at that later). The progressive increase followed the rise of crude oil prices in the context of the geopolitical energy crises of the 1970s. The oil price peaked in 1979 at around $40/bbl, then progressively decreased to $30 until the 1985 downturn (the first of its kind, based on market capture philosophies of NOCs), where oil prices declined to $10. In 1985, SPE membership peaked at 54,000 professionals and remained below this number for more than 20 years. As a note, the relatively stable level of SPE membership during the 1985 downturn suggests that most petroleum professionals maintained their SPE membership while seeking employment. In the wake of the 1985 downturn, I fault our industry for failing to hire enough YPs for nearly a decade. The impact of this inaction is seen in SPE’s demographics 25 years later, as shown in Fig. 4, which displays the demographic split of members by age groups in 2013. There was a clear “valley” in the 40–44-year-old range, corresponding to engineers who did not enter the industry during the 1985 downturn. In 2013, I served on the SPE Board of Directors as Technical Director for Reservoir. The concern for SPE and the industry at large had a name: the “big crew change”—the time when the peak of the SPE membership, aged between 50 and 59, would leave the industry and be replaced by significantly fewer, less experienced engineers. From 2000 to 2010, numerous SPE events and discussions focused on the big crew change. Topics such as talent attraction and retention, knowledge retention and management, and mentoring/lifelong learning were major concerns for companies large and small—from operators to service and manufacturing sectors. From 1986 to 2004—A Global Stagnation, but a Demographic and Power Shift As shown in Fig. 5, in the nearly 20 years that followed the 1985 downturn, we saw stagnated recovery, cyclic variations in oil prices with small “crises” of limited amplitude, and an essentially stable SPE professional membership of around 50,000. However, this relatively uneventful membership curve does not reflect some of the spectacular changes that took place in our industry and within SPE during the same period. The “shift of power” from IOCs to NOCs—no comment, everyone witnessed it. The transfer of technical leadership to service companies. Until the early 1990s, virtually every major IOC would have an R&D center with a full spectrum of technical and logistical talent. This sometimes led to “reinventing the wheel” in isolation and was often not a financially optimized enterprise. But at the time, IOCs were leading the industry in both technology innovation and dissemination. With a few exceptions, almost all R&D centers were abandoned in the 1990s, and the global R&D workload was de facto transferred to service companies (and, to a lesser degree, academia). The end of technical authority. Analogous to R&D, until the early 1990s, the de facto technical authority in petroleum engineering resided with the IOC R&D centers and their SMEs. While the technical contributions of academics were significant, the IOCs defined the state of the art and determined whether a new technology or method should replace an older one. This “technical authority” role disappeared alongside the decline in IOC investment in R&D. Service companies then took on technical development leadership, and the technical authority was replaced by a commercial contest. Lastly, and for very different reasons, neither NOCs nor SPE assumed the role of technical authority. SPE could have attempted to take on at least part of this role, but frankly, it was not part of SPE’s mission to impose its view on technical standards. The (only) notable exception to this was reserves classifications via the Petroleum Resource Management System (PRMS), where the protocol evolved in response to the need for an objective, global standard for oil and gas reserves. As shown in Fig. 6, after 1985, SPE began its “globalization” shift, moving away from a US-dominated membership to a majority international. For reference, when SPE began as a separate society in 1957, nearly 90% its membership was US-based. As shown in Fig. 6, the non-US member percentage began to increase in 1985. From 1985 to 2004, the percentage of non-US-based members rose from 18 to 54%, continuing to the present, where this percentage exceeds 70%. From 2005 to 2015—When the Sky Seemed to be the Limit In Fig. 7, the period 2005–2015 is highlighted. Due to the focus on unconventional resources and the associated learning curve, the industry (and SPE membership) grew exceptionally during this period, with an increase of 50,000 members. This growth was similar to the growth SPE experienced in the 1975—1985 period, when SPE saw an increase of 30,000 members. Even the 2008 global financial crisis had no effect on SPE membership growth. In addition to our professional membership doubling from 50,000 to 99,000 members from 2005 to 2015, SPE events, finances, and member programs also increased proportionally with the increase in membership. In Fig. 8 presents the “health of our membership” demographic plot. The health of SPE can be assessed by comparing the number of professional members by their year of birth vs. date to birth, illustrating the evolution of our age-related membership distributions. While SPE collects detailed information on membership by age, geographic region, etc., these data have only been collected since 2010. Two caveats: The first pertains to the membership statistics—these data are taken from our members’ profiles. We do not check this member information for accuracy (although we do not expect it to be deliberately erroneous), nor do we require it to be submitted. For example, in 2023, we had 67,900 members but only 53,200 members, or about 80%, actually completed their SPE membership profile. However, this completion rate should not bias our study, assuming it remained constant and statistically balanced across age groups (which we cannot verify). The second caveat concerns the number of SPE members. Sometimes, we draw conclusions about the number of professionals in our industry based on membership numbers. Such conclusions are fine if our “member assumption” is correct—that the number of members in a given age category reflects the number of relevant active professionals, multiplied by SPE’s “market share” (where market share refers to SPE’s ability to convince these professionals to join and remain members). Based on Fig. 8, we can make the following observations: From 2015 to 2024—Downturns, Pandemic, Energy Transition, and a New Normal The impact of the 2015 downturn, the pandemic, and the relative stabilization since 2021 (already summarized in Fig. 1) is illustrated again in Fig. 9. Fig. 10 shows the evolution of SPE’s demographics over the same period. Any concerns in 2014 about losing the late baby boomer generation and their experience were instantly forgotten in 2015 to preserve our stakeholders’ profitability and the survival of some of them. These late baby boomers (my generation) have been and are leaving the industry, some willingly, some not. The demographic “valley” corresponding to members born between 1955 and 1970 has now become a “step.” In addition, there has been an overall reduction in membership , including among those now in their forties. Many of these people have left the industry for good, although some have returned over the past 3 years. But, the most concerning issue is the demographic of our youngest members, born between 1995 and 2005. On the right of Fig. 10, we can compare the 2015 demographic curve (green) with that of 2024 (red). In 2024, we will see stabilization at 800 members per year, an all-time low that may represent, depending on the reality behind it, an existential long-term threat. This figure is even far below the 1,500-historical “valley” from the 1985 downturn. The number of SPE professional members in a given age category is the product of the number of active professionals and the percentage of those who decide to become and remain SPE members. The current low level may result from a sheer reduction in the number of young professionals in the industry, a low appetite to join and remain with SPE, or a combination of both. There is not much we can do about the raw number of professionals in the industry, but we can work to improve our cost/benefit ratio and increase the attractiveness of SPE to them (and their careers). To do this we can start by looking first at our student statistics (Fig. 11). Looking at Historical Student Member Statistics Until 2002, SPE student membership was not free, but was available at a reduced price. As shown in Fig. 11, student membership increased consistently from the 1970s until the 1985 downturn. It reached a minimum in 1990 before recovering to pre-1985 downturn levels in 1994. In 2002, the decision to provide free SPE membership to students led to an exponential increase in the number of student members (perhaps as expected). Student membership reached an all-time high of about 73,000 in 2016, before the effects of the 2015 downturn and the pandemic caused it to drop, bottoming out at about 52,000. Over the past 2 years, we have seen a substantial rebound, with student membership reaching about 64,000. To put a value on this, providing free student memberships costs SPE $700,000 per year, $150,000 of that amount sponsored annually by Chevron (and previously by Halliburton). One of the tasks on our to-do list is to establish a global sponsorship program to finance 100% of SPE student membership. From a financial point of view, SPE views free student memberships as a “member value” that we can accommodate. However, we obviously welcome corporate support for programs like this. I must now state the obvious: we subsidize student memberships to entice student engagement and participation, with the hope that it motivates them to “convert” to professional membership once they enter the workforce. To bridge the gap between when a student leaves academia and joins the industry, SPE provides a free first year of professional membership. However, our retention rates after this first year are significantly less than desired, which means we need to help students see the value of SPE and encourage them to “invest” in SPE by becoming dues-paying members. We must ask ourselves: why does an SPE student member not become a professional member? I will suggest possible reasons: The SPE Board and I are considering mechanisms and programs to create a transition path from completely free membership (as a student member) to full-cost SPE membership once they are no longer students. The proposals at this point would scale the cost to SPE to just below the current cost of the free student membership program, and it could (and should) convince students to join SPE as professional members while beginning their careers in the industry. This column is meant to shed light, not curse the darkness. My goal is to identify the realities of our membership statistics over time as we have evolved as a professional society. These statistics clearly show that SPE is relevant to its members’ careers, but we need to translate this relevance into momentum. I have extracted the conclusions and potential actions that could be taken to achieve the highest levels of member engagement and value. These conclusions and action items are summarized below. Actions Items I thank you for joining me this month and look forward to seeing you again next month. While I won’t promise anything, I will do my best to keep future columns at a more palatable length. I was “hired” as your 2025 SPE President to align resources and value for SPE, and I always welcome your input, whether it’s critical, neutral, or complimentary. Feel free to email me at president@spe.org. Visit my SPE Connect channel, “President JPT Column–Discussion Page,” to share your thoughts and insights. However, the 1985 downturn and subsequent years were a very real shock to our profession. For young engineers, it may be hard to imagine that, until this time, the career model was to hold a job with a single employer for the entirety of one’s career. I recall well my 1982 interview with Shell in The Hague, where potential career paths were described, with the expectation that, if you joined Shell, you would retire from Shell after 30-plus years on the job. (I joined Flopetrol-Schlumberger, and was immediately trained and sent to reasonably harsh jobs in the Middle East and the North Sea.) This was a time when technical careers and management careers were considered equivalent choices. This “equity” exploded with the 1985 downturn and vanished completely in the following 10 or so years. In my opinion, this discrepancy between management and technical roles can (at least partly) explain the decisions made by our stakeholders during the crises that followed. In the subsequent industry cycles (up until, but not including 2015), it even became a sort of game—some of my industry colleagues would happily accept a redundancy package, wait a few months, and then be hired at a higher salary—sometimes by the same company. As an aside, when times are tough, as you may be experiencing now, you may be told that crises are times of both challenges and opportunities—citing a Chinese proverb which, apparently (if you believe the internet), is not about this at all. You may be tempted to shrug this off as a weak, self‑fulfilling argument. But I beg to differ. In 1987, following the 1985 downturn, I used the funds from my severance package to start my company in a closet, alongside a former Flopetrol colleague. Everyone (including us) believed that it was the worst possible time to start a company, and in retrospect, it was absolutely the best time. The 1985 downturn shaped my response to everything that followed, including the fact that I am now writing this column. Crises do, indeed, come with opportunities. To be honest, I was 28 in 1987, and I must confess that I had strong doubts about that Chinese proverb. The effect of the downturn was challenging to professionals and catastrophic for students. Many abandoned their petroleum studies, while some—though not enough—chose the (wise) option of extending their studies to pursue a master’s degree or PhD until the dust settled.

Revolutionizing ESP Performance: How a Global Oilfield Services Company Reduced Total Cost of Ownership With Arlon 3000XT®,https://jpt.spe.org/revolutionizing-esp-performance-how-a-global-oilfield-services-company-reduced-total-cost-of-ownership-with-arlon-3000xt,"A leading global oilfield services provider faced significant reliability issues when stators, electrical connectors, and sealing systems within their ESPs were failing. Their existing material solution—machined from polyimides—presented multiple problems. With ESPs' reliability on the line and operational expenses rising, the oilfield services company sought a superior material solution that could withstand these conditions while enhancing long-term performance and cost efficiency.
A Breakthrough in ESP Insulation: Arlon 3000XT® Recognizing the urgent need for a more durable, high-performance insulating material, Greene Tweed (GT) initiated an extensive root-cause analysis in 2023. Their goal: To find a solution that would address the application constraints while delivering superior thermal, mechanical, and electrical insulation properties. After a multiphase material testing program, Arlon 3000XT, a patented crosslinked PEEK (polyetheretherketone) thermoplastic, emerged as the optimal choice. Unlike traditional materials, Arlon 3000XT is engineered to thrive in extreme oilfield conditions—offering exceptional electrical insulation, high-temperature resistance, and enhanced durability in high-pressure, high-moisture environments. The Science Behind the Solution
The validation and qualification process for Arlon 3000XT was rigorous, ensuring that the material not only met but exceeded industry expectations. Key testing phases included: 1. Coupon Testing for Material Qualification The first step in validating Arlon 3000XT was coupon testing, assessing its thermal stability, electrical insulation properties, and moisture resistance. The results confirmed its ability to withstand temperatures ranging from 260°C to 300°C ( 500°F to 572°F), while maintaining mechanical and electrical integrity. 2. Machined Prototype Verification Once the baseline properties were validated, GT engineers produced machined prototypes for further testing. This phase was critical in ensuring that real-world ESP conditions would not compromise the material’s form, fit, and function. 3. Injection Molding for Production Efficiency Unlike polyimides, which required time-intensive machining, Arlon 3000XT enabled the production of injection-molded components.

The Key Role of Weighted Average Cost of Capital and Opportunity Costs in Investment Decisions and Understanding Discount Rates,https://jpt.spe.org/the-key-role-of-weighted-average-cost-of-capital-and-opportunity-costs-in-investment-decisions-and-understanding-discount-rates,"This article delves into the core aspects of discount rates, focusing on two pivotal concepts: the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) and opportunity cost, and how they shape investment evaluation. In economic analysis, determining the appropriate discount rate is a critical component in evaluating the present value of future cash flows. The discount rate should reflect the opportunity cost associated with an investment, enabling businesses and investors to make informed decisions. In technical terms, the discount rate is used to convert future cash flows into present value, essentially reflecting the time value of money with a particular investment. In simpler terms, it’s the required return that an investor needs to earn to generate a desired profit, making the project acceptable. Selecting the correct discount rate is crucial because it can significantly influence the valuation of a project. If the discount rate is too high, promising investments may be rejected, while an overly low rate could result in overinvestment in projects that do not actually have positive value. The proper rate you want to consider should be a combination of many factors. The WACC is one of the most-used discount rates. WACC represents the average rate of return required by the company's security holders, including equity investors, debt holders, and other forms of capital providers. Each source of capital is weighted according to its proportion in the company’s overall capital structure. In the broadest sense, the WACC is a weighted average return a company would need to make to pay back its bond/credit holders (cost of debt) and the anticipated stock returns of the shareholders (cost of equity) and have no money left over for itself. It is a true minimum return that is required to finance a project. If all projects are selected down to the WACC, then a company would maximize the profit to the firm. Sounds good, right?! The problem with WACC is it assumes capital budget dollars are unlimited, or at least sufficient to achieve the optimum level of selected projects. In our experience, this is not the case. Most, if not all companies set capital budgets at the beginning of the year, or quarter. They then decide which projects should be undertaken based on the limited capital budget available at that time; this limits the projects that can be selected and does not allow the company to achieve the theoretical maximum profit. In that case, the WACC percentage would not truly reflect the minimum project return; there would still be a list of projects above the company’s WACC but not able to be selected due to capital budget constraints. An opportunity cost refers to the return that is forgone by choosing one investment over another. When companies evaluate multiple projects, each with different rates of return, the opportunity cost is the return of the next-best project that is not undertaken. For example, if a company invests in a project with a 21% return and runs out of capital, the next project offering a 20% return becomes the opportunity cost. In practice, firms often use the opportunity cost of capital to assess whether their investments are generating sufficient returns compared to other alternatives. This approach can provide a more accurate measure of required returns than WACC alone, particularly when capital is limited. Some companies use growth targets as a way of estimating the opportunity cost of capital. A growth target is loosely based on the same idea as an opportunity cost of capital, but instead of looking backwards at past projects, growth rates look forward. The anticipated minimum is selected based on the anticipated growth target set in the future. A popular tool for estimating growth targets is the Rule of 72, which calculates how long it takes for an investment to double. By dividing 72 by the desired number of years to double the investment, companies can estimate the required annual return. For example, to double capital in 5 years, a 14.4% annual return is needed. If the company wants to double in 3 years, a 24% annual return is needed. This provides a quick way to establish a minimum return threshold for future investments. While WACC is frequently used as the base discount rate for corporate-level decision-making and often cited in financial publications, using it as a universal discount rate for projects can be misleading and result in inaccurate project valuations based on project-specific risk, return requirements, and capital budget dollars available. Incorporating the opportunity cost of capital, which reflects the forgone return of alternative investments, provides a more nuanced and accurate approach to project evaluation. In summary, the discount rate is a critical factor in determining the present value of future cash flows. While the weighted average cost of capital is widely used, it has its limitations, particularly when dealing with capital constraints. Integrating opportunity cost provides a more comprehensive view of potential returns and helps firms make better, more informed decisions. By considering both WACC and opportunity cost, companies can ensure that they are not only meeting minimum return requirements but also optimizing their capital allocation for long-term success.

Getting Drill-Ready for the Energy Transition,https://jpt.spe.org/getting-drill-ready-for-the-energy-transition,"If we don’t include the subsurface in the journey towards net zero, it will be impossible to reach it. However, we can’t just copy drilling routines from the oil and gas sector to the energy transition, because we know that drilling for geothermal energy production or storing CO2 in the subsurface requires a vastly different approach to material selection and technology. At the same time, it is also important to be aware that renewables are more cash-constrained than oil and gas. This means that innovation is required to bring down these costs whilst maintaining high-spec material properties at the same time. That is what we do at the Rijswijk Center for Sustainable Geo-energy (RCSG) in the Netherlands. We play a facilitatory role in the development of new technology such that the full-scale implementation in the field runs as smoothly as possible. At the RCSG, new technology can be tested at downhole conditions and at a 1:1 scale. When Shell decided it was time for another player to continue managing this extensive oil and gas drilling test facility, we saw it as an opportunity to give it another lease of life with the energy transition in mind. In doing so, we target the higher Technical Readiness Levels (TRLs) of product maturation, just before piloting the new solution in the field. Performing tests in a fully controlled environment may point out issues that might either jeopardize field implementation or severely delay it. We have the means to test drill bits and downhole tools and expose the material to different pressure and fluid regimes. We also have a 380-m deep borehole that can serve as a real subsurface laboratory in which we can test the performance of tools and materials that are used for drilling and monitoring. It is a unique facility because we replicate the subsurface conditions as closely as possible. Let’s now look at a few examples of studies the RCSG has recently been involved with, further demonstrating the niche position of the facility. Drilling More Than Twice as Fast When it comes to drilling faster, Dutch startup Canopus developed a new drilling technology that bombards the formation with a continuous flow of small steel particles through a nozzle, thereby weakening the rock before the bit removes it. Prior to testing this technology in Switzerland, the RCSG facilitated a range of experiments whereby the initial design was fine-tuned. The company is now embarking on experiments using a larger bit, and tests have already shown that conventional rates of penetration (ROPs) can be beaten by a factor of 2.5. Temperature Cyclicity One of the differences between oil and gas wells and CO2 injection wells is the cyclicity in bottomhole temperatures. Where oil and gas wells do not tend to experience large temperature variations at depth, this is very different in CO2 injection projects in depleted gas fields where supercritical CO2 expands as soon as it hits the formation, leading to a large cooling effect. This could in theory have a detrimental effect on the integrity of the cement between the casing and the bedrock, potentially leading to micro-fractures and the risk of CO2 migrating upwards through the annuli. Geothermal wells can experience similar thermal stress. The effect of these temperature changes on the integrity of wellbore cement can be simulated in the RSCG lab, at representative bottomhole temperatures. Loops and Grout The drilling of shallow geothermal closed loops has seen a dramatic increase over the past few years, in response to rocketing gas prices and government incentives to decouple domestic heating from the gas grid. The depth limits of these closed loops are now shifting from a “conventional” 200 m to being closer to 500 m, all with the drive to extract more energy and potentially provide blocks of residential houses with baseload energy instead of having one loop for each home. Once the loop has been placed in the well, the boreholes are filled with grout, a mixture of cement and clay, to prevent any crossflow. Due to extraction of energy from the circulating fluids by the heat pump, temperatures in the borehole can drop close to freezing. We are now looking at how these grout mixtures behave when exposed to higher pressures and potentially larger temperature variations. We monitor permeability changes of the grout under those circumstances, which will enable us to provide recommendations with regards to the best cement-clay mixture. How To Ensure Hole Stability? In the Netherlands and many other sedimentary basins across the world, there is an increasing interest in exploring reservoir sands at relatively shallow depths (from 800 to 1500 m) for open-loop geothermal systems that can be directly used for low-temperature heat grids or as input for heat pumps. The clear advantage of tapping into reservoirs at this depth range is the likelihood of finding much better reservoir quality than when going deeper, which also takes away an important risk element. However, in return for better reservoir quality, lower water temperatures in the region of 30 to 50°C are commonly encountered. This requires higher extraction rates in order to produce similar amounts of energy compared to deeper systems. At the RCSG, we work on this from various angles. First of all, drilling rigs are an issue. Groundwater drillers are not allowed to drill beyond depths of 500 m because they don’t have the right safety measures in place, whilst an oil/gas rig is too expensive to use for holes of this kind. We are looking at ways to make it possible to have the best of both options—the agility and affordable running costs of groundwater drilling rigs and the safety features of more powerful oil and gas drilling installations. Secondly, we are looking at ways to optimize circulation in horizontal wells that are to be drilled in these poorly consolidated sands. Circulating too much may lead to washouts, but circulating too little leaves the cuttings in the hole. There is a narrow operational window here, and we clearly need to test this to find out what the best operational procedure is. Working Together After 5 years of getting projects and technologies closer to maturation, it can be concluded that the Rijswijk Center for Sustainable Geo-energy has cemented its role in the development and demonstration arena. We are here to help the implementation of subsurface projects in the energy transition. One thing that we are now particularly keen on is to start collaborating more with oil and gas companies that are looking to branch out into the geothermal or the subsurface storage space, and how our center can be used as part of the process that is often required to progress drilling technology towards successful implementation in the field. We welcome any companies interested in this to get in touch with us at tno.nl/rcsg. Want to know more about advanced drilling technology? Sign up for our webinar on 2 December 2024.

CFD Analysis Validates Novel Approach To Mitigating Gas Locking in Wells Using Sucker Rod Pumps,https://jpt.spe.org/cfd-analysis-validates-novel-approach-to-mitigating-gas-locking-in-wells-using-sucker-rod-pumps,"According to SPE 165039, “Gas locking has been a problem accompanying the ball-and- seat sucker rod pump ever since its inception in the oil industry.” This article explores the intricacies of this age-old problem, outlining the causes, consequences, and costs of gas locking, as well as highlighting a novel approach to mitigation that has recently been validated by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) research. What Is ""Gas Locking"" in Oil Wells That Also Produce Entrained Gas? Gas that remains in the solution when the liquid enters the pump increases the volume of total fluid through the pump compared to the liquid measured at the surface by the formation volume factor at pump-intake conditions. The gas also decreases the density of the fluid and, thus, the head or pressure to be pumped against in the tubing. Free gas that enters the pump must be compressed to a pressure equivalent to the head required to lift the fluid. This free gas will reduce the volume of both the produced liquid that enters the pump and the liquid measured at the surface. Any time the pump does not compress the free gas to a pressure greater than that exerted on the pump by the fluid column in the producing string, production ceases and the pump is said to be “gas locked.” Why Is Gas Locking of a Sucker Rod Pump So Detrimental to Production? When a pump gas locks, the area in the pump barrel below the plunger contains mainly gas—and gas is compressible, where fluid is not. In this scenario, the hydrostatic pressure of the column of fluid and gas above the traveling valve of the plunger is greater than the compressed pressure of the gas below the plunger in the barrel of the pump. Therefore, as the pump operates, all that happens within the pump is gas compression and expansion. Effectively, on the upstroke you have gas expansion, and on the downstroke, you have gas compression. In both instances, the traveling valve ball remains on its seat with no new entry of oil into the pump on the downstroke, and subsequently, no new fluid produced into the tubing and displaced to the surface as production. Essentially the pump jack on the surface is just going up and down without any fluid produced to the tanks. The Role of Standard B2 Tubing Anchors in Causing or Exacerbating Gas Locking Tubing anchors are often an important part of the downhole production string. In wells using rod pump systems, the anchors can stabilize the production string. That stability prevents unnecessary cyclic movement of the tubing that can cause tubing failure and reduced rod pump efficiency and life. However, that same standard anchor can create serious problems with well production. That was the finding of a research study conducted by Echometer Company. The Texas-based software firm offers solutions for analyzing and optimizing the performance of oil, gas and water wells. In this case, the firm studied the production rates of 11 oil wells. Each well had high fluid levels and the pump intake was located below the perforations. Yet despite these seemingly favorable conditions, nine of the wells showed a pump fillage rate of less than 90%. According to the report: “In these wells that exhibited high fluid levels … the fluid distribution in the wellbore below the liquid level was not uniform. The wellbore in the vicinity of the pump intake was primarily filled with gas with a minimal volume of liquid. …The presence of a tubing anchor set high above the pump intake is considered to be the main cause of this uneven distribution of fluids in the wellbore. “The particular tubing anchor used in these wells provides a flow area of about 2.9 square inches between the body of the anchor and the casing compared to a flow area of 14.4 square inches between the casing (4.892-in. ID) and the tubing (2.375-in. OD). The small flow area could increase the velocity of the upward flowing gas to the point where it would be difficult for liquid present in the upper part of the annulus to flow downward past the depth where the tubing anchor is set. The anchor would essentially act as a choke and also cause an increase of the annular back pressure.” In other words, the tubing anchor itself was restricting the flow of gas up through the annulus of the well. The gas that did escape had an increased velocity. That velocity made it difficult for fluid above the anchor to fall past it and reach the pump. In turn, the fluid around the pump had a high gas content, making highly efficient production impossible. Tubing Anchors Can Provide a ""False Positive"" Another key finding in the report was related to the fluid levels in these wells. In many cases, the fluid levels above the anchors appeared higher than they actually were. The report states: “Fluid level depression tests were used to confirm that free gas can collect below a tubing anchor and prevent the liquid present in the gaseous column above the tubing anchor from falling to the bottom of the wellbore and to the pump intake.” Said differently, the fluid above the anchor was unable to fall past the anchor at a significant enough rate to allow full pump fillage and decrease the overall fluid level. This phenomenon essentially gave operators a false reading, since they thought they had high fluid levels. However, the reality was that fluid just couldn’t get past the anchor as quickly as it was being pumped out. Two Alternative Design Options The Echometer report notes that removing the anchor or moving it below the perforations should resolve the issue. Of course, neither option is necessarily ideal. Removing the anchor would increase the flow area within the casing. However, it would also cause the cyclic movement of the tubing string. And although setting the anchor below the perforations can be an effective model with the right equipment, many engineers and field operators are wary of this approach. Door Number Three: Using a ""Slim"" Tubing Anchor Catcher In addition to the report’s suggestions, a third option for mitigating the interference of formation gas does exist: Deploying a tubing anchor catcher with a reduced OD, such as the Slimline® TAC from TechTAC®. The patented design of the Slimline anchor provides up to 245% more flow-by area, between the anchor and the well casing than a standard B2 TAC. That flow area allows formation gas to more easily flow up around the anchor, while sediment can more easily fall past it. Using terminology from the Echometer study, while the standard anchor creates a “choke,” causing restrictive turbulent flow, the Slimline, with its tapered design and smaller diameter, allows for a laminar flow path. Validated by CFD Analysis A recent CFD study from the independent consulting firm Imaginationeering confirmed these benefits. The study examined the “gas flow within the annular space around two types of a 5.5-in. tubing anchor catcher to assess the differences between them in terms of flow parameters.” Specifically, the analysis evaluated the performance of a standard B2 tubing anchor catcher and the Slimline TAC relative to fluid velocity, pressure drop, turbulence, vorticity and other factors. The resulting report highlighted two key findings: Significant Pressure Drop Around the Standard B2 Tubing Anchor Catcher
One of the most noteworthy findings of the CFD study dealt with the pressure drop around each anchor. The team at Imaginationeering found that the net pressure drop around a standard B2 tubing anchor catcher, as fluid/gas passes through the annular cavity around the anchor, is more than double the pressure drop around the Slimline TAC. According to the study: “… the pressure drop along the standard TAC is more than double that drop along the Slimline TAC. This is expected because the annular cavity with the Slimline TAC’s case is wider than that for the standard TAC’s case. Furthermore, the pressure drop change in the Slimline TAC’s case is less abrupt than that in the standard TAC’s case in which a noticeable localized drop prior to the downstream connector is observed.” Less Turbulence and Vorticity Around the Slimline TAC The Slimline anchor also demonstrated a noticeable advantage over the standard B2 tubing anchor catcher in reducing the overall turbulence and vorticity strengths within the flow field. The report noted, “The observed abrupt changes in the pressure field along with the potential presence of flow field obstacles in the case of the standard TAC is expected to generate more turbulence within the flow field along the TAC in comparison with the Slimline TAC’s case … Further, the vorticity strength in the flow field of the Standard TAC is expected to be significantly present in comparison to that of the Slimline TAC’s case …” The Impact of the CFD Study Findings The significant pressure drop and increased turbulence and vorticity as fluid passes around the standard B2 TAC can have a material impact on well production. Those parameters are major contributors in the formation of scale, iron sulfide, and paraffin, as well as the advent of gas locking. In contrast, the CFD study highlights multiple benefits of running the TechTAC Slimline anchor: Conclusion Gas locking is a common and challenging issue in the oil field—one that can have significant consequences for production rates and operating costs. Understanding the causes and consequences of gas locking is essential for oil producers to implement effective mitigation strategies. One of the most cost-effective ways to mitigate gas locking in sucker rod pump (SRP) systems is by deploying a Slimline TAC from TechTAC. The Slimline’s unique design dramatically increases flow-by capacity, which reduces the occurrence of gas locking by directing gas around the anchor instead of through the pump. By minimizing the frequency and impact of gas locking, production companies can significantly reduce costs, increase run time, and increase the production of oil well operations.

"Closed-Loop Geothermal Test Site Takes Shape in Texas with NOV, Key Partners",https://jpt.spe.org/closed-loop-geothermal-test-site-takes-shape-in-texas-with-nov-key-partners,"About an hour north of Houston, NOV recently drilled an 11,500-ft-deep closed-loop geothermal test well, one of the newest of its kind. The drilling and completions technology provider hosted a multicompany forum at the site in January, drawing other industry players that are collaborating to successfully develop the technology. Unlike traditional geothermal systems that rely on natural hydrothermal resources, closed-loop geothermal (CLG) systems use a sealed underground loop to circulate a working fluid. This fluid absorbs heat from the hot rock formations underground and transports it to the surface for energy generation or direct heating. Chuck Wright, NOV’s corporate director of research and development, told guests during the visit that NOV’s initial focus was on creating a medium-sized facility with a 1,500-hp drilling rig and a 20,000-ft vertical capability, but the facility has since expanded beyond drilling operations to include a “completions playground” with coiled tubing operations and 70 wells across the north and south pads that can be repurposed for geothermal tests. NOV’s test well, initially planned to reach 12,000 ft, was completed at 11,500 ft, said Wright. Despite the adjustment, the well reached 278°F, surpassing the required 250°F and marking a successful test. The results highlight both the progress and remaining challenges in geothermal technology, underscoring the need for further upgrades in the field. The facility’s design includes options for supercritical fluids transport and preservation, though these elements have not yet been implemented. NOV is also looking at ways to incorporate more digital solutions at the wellsite in an effort to promote data sharing and collaboration throughout the industry. Project Collaboration The potential for CLG systems is considered to be expansive on a technical basis, with ongoing research and development aimed at optimizing performance and expanding its commercial application. Companies including Greenfire Energy, which took part in NOV’s demonstration event, are among those betting big on the potential of CLG technology. GreenFire is the developer of an integrated subsurface, wellbore, and surface modeling system that estimates the net power from a given asset. Other solution providers included Vallourec, which showcased its vacuum-insulated tubulars that feature an integrated fiber-optics system to measure temperature data and estimate bottomhole fluid temperature. NOV is working as a systems integrator with these companies, embracing collaboration to advance its geothermal prospects. Perhaps the biggest question still unanswered on CLG involves its cost efficiency. Skeptics argue that heat conduction in these types of geothermal wells transfers energy into the wellbore too slowly, resulting in low power output per foot of wellbore. Added Efficiency However, Wright and others championing CLG are confident that innovations in robotics and automation can create more efficiencies and bring costs down by speeding up key processes. “Geothermal on the drilling side, has lagged a little bit on some of the efficiencies that have been found in the oil and gas space that haven’t translated into geothermal,” he said. ""The digital aspect has been a component of the field, but there is a desire to move things along, and that’s all speaking to efficiencies. And the oil and gas has been driving efficiencies.” And while automation and development of the digital components of the technology can add greater efficiency to the wellsite, even more can be achieved by managing reservoir temperatures which correspondingly reduce the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), John Clegg, president and CTO of Hephae Energy, said during a panel at the NOV test site. “Levelized cost of electricity is a function of a number of things, but one of those is reservoir temperature,” he said. “We did a bunch of modeling and we realized this tremendous leverage in terms of cost of electricity versus reservoir temperature … from 200°C to 300°C, you don’t get reductions in electricity of a few percent, but rather in the 50% range.” Such cost-efficiency leverage would encourage future projects. Most commercial tools are specified for temperatures of up to 175°C to 185°C, with very few working effectively at or beyond 200°C. One forum speaker noted that many tools designed to work within these ranges fail well below them—at around 120°C to 140°C—raising concerns about reliability in geothermal applications. During drilling operations, the temperature inside measurement-while-drilling tools can rise rapidly when circulation stops (e.g., during connections or tripping). This affects the tools’ reliability and lifespan. “The reliability of electronics is governed by the rule of thumb: for every 10°C increase in temperature, you approximately halve the reliability. Conversely, if you go down in temperature, you double the reliability,” Clegg said. NOV’s collaboration with industry partners underscores the oil and gas sector’s push into geothermal energy. However, CLG’s broader adoption will depend on further advancements in automation and digital technology, as well as proving its economic viability.

First Oil Flows at Chevron’s $47 Billion Upgrade at Kazakhstan’s Tengiz Field,https://jpt.spe.org/first-oil-flows-at-chevrons-47-billion-upgrade-at-kazakhstans-tengiz-field,"First oil from Chevron’s $47 billion production upgrade to Kazakhstan’s Tengizchevroil (TCO) venture is flowing after the startup of TCO’s Future Growth Project (FGP)—the last phase of an expansion to keep Tengiz, the world’s deepest producing supergiant oil field, on stream for the next generation. Tengiz is Central Asia’s largest oil producer, featuring the largest single-trap producing reservoir in existence and an oil column measuring 1 mile (1.6 km). Chevron operates Tengiz through its 50% interest in the TCO joint venture; partners include Kazakhstan’s NOC, KazMunayGas (20%); ExxonMobil (25%); and LukArco, a subsidiary of Russia’s Lukoil (5%). With the FGP’s commissioning on 24 January, Chevron dropped into place the final element of a two-phase expansion plan on which it had taken a final investment decision in 2016, expecting to finish the project in 2022. However, the COVID-19 pandemic, along with logistical and regulatory challenges, hindered progress. Production Rates to Ramp Up Quickly Chevron CEO Michael Wirth told analysts at the company’s 4Q earnings call on 31 January that TCO “expects to achieve full production rates of 1 million BOE/D within the next 3 months” based on the additional 260,000 bbl of expanded oil production capacity that the FGP adds to existing plants. In April, Chevron commissioned Phase 1 of the two-step expansion, the Wellhead Pressure Management Project (WPMP), which is designed to optimize the field and processing plants. Upgraded sour gas-injection technologies to enhance oil recovery lie at the heart of the FGP expansion along with the just commissioned 12-mtpa-capacity, third-generation processing plant, the third and last processing facility included in the expansion plan. Digital innovations have been integrated into the project including automated process controls, digital twin, real-time data visualization, wireless safety sensors, and electronic work permit systems. SPE 223452, authored by Tengizchevroil and presented at the 2024 SPE Caspian Technical Conference and Exhibition, spotlighted cutting-edge geographic information system SimOps maps as playing a critical role in optimizing project management. Latest Upgrades Across the Board The FGP and WPMP are separate but complementary projects aimed at extending TCO’s production plateau and keeping existing plants producing at full capacity. Taken together they represent installed power systems with five Frame 9 gas turbine generators, four large new compression trains with additional pumping capacity, a new centralized control center and enhanced sour-gas handling and reinjection to the field for long-term pressure maintenance, according to TCO. The project’s sour-gas-injection technology was already proven during TCO’s 2008 expansion, and the WPMP maintains plant capacity by lowering the flow pressure at the wellhead and then boosting the pressure to the inlet requirements of the processing trains. Details on the implementation of both of these key technologies used in the TCO upgrade are found in SPE 223475 which documents experience in resolving well startup challenges in TCO’s high-pressure gathering system before conversion to low pressure, and SPE 203995 highlighting sour-gas injection. With the 40-year Tengiz concession due to end in 2033, the investment community is already asking when and if Chevron and its TCO partners might open negotiations. “As we get through the ramp-up to see the plant and reservoir performance, we'll then be able to really turn our focus to the future,” Wirth said after analysts raised the question at the 4Q earnings call. “We've got a long proud history in Kazakhstan and with the TCO partnership, and we certainly would like to extend the concession, but it has to work for everyone,” Wirth said. While the FGP primarily targets increased production at Tengiz, its broader operational scope within TCO also covers the Korolev field. Combined, Tengiz and Korolev hold estimated recoverable crude oil reserves of approximately 7.5 billion bbl and 469 Bcm (approximately 16.6 Tcf) of gas, representing 12% of Kazakhstan’s recoverable gas reserves, according to Chevron’s Kazakh partner KazMunayGas.

"Equinor To Cut Renewables Investment by 50%, Boost Oil and Gas Output",https://jpt.spe.org/equinor-to-cut-renewables-investment-by-50-boost-oil-and-gas-output,"Equinor announced significant changes to its investment strategy, reducing investments in renewables over the next 2 years by 50% to $5 billion, down from approximately $10 billion. It will also drop its target to spend half of its fixed assets budget on renewables and low-carbon products by 2030 “to adapt to market conditions and further strengthen value creation for shareholders” and “to underline that value creation is at the core of decision making,” according to a release of 4Q 2024 and full-year 2024 results on 4 February. The company has lowered its expected capacity in renewables to 10–12 GW by 2030, down from its previous target of 12–16 GW. Its focus on oil and gas production will increase, with expectations of more than 10% growth from 2024 to 2027, from 2 million BOED to 2.2 million BOED by 2030. Production from the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS) is expected to maintain at a level of around 1.2 million BOED to 2035. Equinor will continue to develop existing fields on the NCS and its international projects. “Driving increased recovery and exploration near infrastructure is expected to bring high-value volumes with short lead time, low cost, and low emissions,” the press release said. Equinor CEO Anders Opedal said in the release, “Equinor is well positioned for further growth and competitive shareholder returns. We expect to deliver industry-leading return on average capital employed, above 15% all the way to 2030. Our oil and gas production outlook is increased to more than 10% growth from 2024 to 2027. “We strengthen our expected free cash flow significantly compared to last year’s outlook. We do this by high-grading the portfolio, reducing the investment outlook for renewables and low-carbon solutions, and improving cost across our organization.” During the 4Q call on 5 February, Opedal said the company is facing three global trends affecting energy markets. 1. Global growth in energy demand. Global oil demand is expected to top 100 million B/D through this decade. Equinor expects natural gas demand to ""increase and stay above today's level to 2050,"" he said. (The International Energy Agency reported that global gas demand reached approximately 4,200 Bcm in 2024.) 2. Geopolitical tension, tariffs, and increased uncertainty in commodity markets. ""Oil demand is increasing with slow growth in Asia, and higher supply from non-OPEC countries add uncertainty to the price outlook."" 3. Uneven pace of the energy transition. ""It is moving fast in some markets, slow in most. Even the massive renewable growth is currently energy addition, not energy transition. In low-carbon solutions, different technologies are progressing at different pace. ""Carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects have many similar traits as oil and gas and our capabilities are in place. The regulatory frameworks are progressing, and customers are interested."" Although not explicitly mentioned, Equinor holds interests in both the Northern Endurance Partnership and the Net Zero Teesside Power CCS projects. The final investment decisions and financial closings for these projects were announced in December 2024. Opedal said, ""We are ready but we'll only execute if we get long-term commitment from our customers. We have excess storage capacity of 60 million tonnes of CO2 per year, adding 20 million last year and maintained our ambition."" Opedal added, ""Different technologies move at a different pace. And particularly on hydrogen, we see that customers are coming later to the table to commit to long-term contracts."" He emphasized that reducing the company's own emissions ""is our most important contribution to address climate change. We have an industry-leading low level of emissions from production and maintain our ambition of net 50% reduction by 2030.
Continued effort to cut emissions while producing oil and gas reduces cost, increases returns, and increases the competitiveness. ""Our strategic direction remains the same. We continue to reduce emissions and build profitable business in renewables and low-carbon solutions towards our net-zero ambition.""

"ConocoPhillips Divests Ursa, Europa Stakes for $735 Million",https://jpt.spe.org/conocophillips-divests-ursa-europa-stakes-for-735-million,"ConocoPhillips has entered into an agreement to sell its minority interests in the Ursa and Europa fields and Ursa Oil Pipeline Company LLC to Shell for $735 million. The transaction also includes an overriding royalty interest in the Ursa field. The deal will increase Shell’s working interest in its operated Ursa platform, pipeline, and associated fields from 45.3884% to a maximum of 61.35%, following the agreement, subject to preferential rights election by other working interest partners. ConocoPhillips said proceeds from the transaction will be used for general corporate purposes. “Combined with previously announced dispositions, this transaction reflects our ongoing commitment to further strengthen our portfolio by divesting noncore assets and shows significant progress toward our $2 billion disposition target,” said Andy O’Brien, senior vice president, strategy, commercial, sustainability, and technology at ConocoPhillips. The transaction also includes ConocoPhillips’ 15.96% membership interest in the Shell-operated Ursa Oil Pipeline Company LLC, which will be held by Shell Pipeline Company, ConocoPhillips’ 1% stake in the Europa prospect—also operated by Shell, and ConocoPhillips’ 3.5% overriding royalty interest in Ursa. This royalty interest was acquired by ConocoPhillips through its merger with Marathon Oil completed in November 2024. Full-year 2024 production associated with ConocoPhillips’ 15.96% interest in the Ursa field and 1% stake in the Europa field was approximately 8,000 BOE/D. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of 2025. The effective date of the transaction was 1 January 2025. Shell is the operator of the Ursa tension leg platform (TLP) and currently holds a 45.3884% working interest in the asset with BP Exploration & Production Inc. (22.6916%), ECP GOM III LLC (15.96%), and ConocoPhillips Company (15.96%). “This targeted investment is the latest example of how we are unlocking more value from our existing advantaged upstream assets and infrastructure,” said Zoë Yujnovich, Shell’s Integrated Gas and Upstream Director. “The acquisition expands our ownership in an established long-producing asset that generates robust free cash flow, while also providing more options for growth.” The Ursa TLP, which began production in 1999, is located approximately 130 miles southeast of New Orleans within the Mars Basin. The Ursa/Princess field has produced more than 800 million BOE total gross over roughly 25 years.

,https://jpt.spe.org/seeing-the-unseen-computer-vision-in-action-restricted,"Technology that can analyze visual data with unprecedented speed and accuracy is emerging as a powerful and potentially transformational tool for the industry. Artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and computer vision are a trio of technologies that, when combined, make it possible to interpret images and videos to identity patterns that can be used in many ways. In the oil patch, a supermajor conducted a proof of concept using computer vision to assess hole-cleaning efficiency during well construction, a university developed a workflow for analyzing drill-bit wear to improve drilling parameters, and companies are using the technology to enhance worker safety through real-time monitoring of personal protective equipment (PPE) and the identification of potential hazards. A 3-month proof of concept trial has shown computer vision can assess the quality of hole cleaning during well construction, although some details need to be refined before the technique can be widely deployed. SPE 220985 describes assessing the effectiveness of hole cleaning at five Permian Basin wells by using an image analysis model combined with a remotely monitored and autonomous camera system to measure the recovery rate of drilled cuttings. During a session at SPE’s 2024 Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition in September, Shekhar V. Gosavi, principal borehole management engineer at ExxonMobil, said that as of the time of writing the paper, most of the quantitative measures of hole cleaning using the traditional approach were still in the “art” phase with the accuracy of measurements varying by plus or minus 20%. “That’s not acceptable,” he said. But the proof of concept did indicate that an optical camera can, under the right conditions, measure the volume of cuttings returned to the shaker (Fig. 1), he said. Once refined, real‑time cuttings-returns analysis using computer vision could enable increased drilling speed and lower risks. According to the paper, the “technology has the potential to significantly reduce the nonproductive time associated with circulating and mitigating packoff events, effectively addressing inadequacies in current cuttings-transport modeling and hole‑cleaning practices.” Prior to the trials, the vendor, DrillDocs, worked with a team at The University of Tulsa Drilling Research Projects to validate the image analysis model against a cuttings-transport model developed at the university. DrillDocs engaged BlackHawk Datacom to provide technical support during mobilization, ensuring that the system was installed by experienced personnel with minimal impact on active drilling operations. To conduct the trials, ExxonMobil installed an explosion-proof optical camera with onboard image analysis software near the shale shaker, turning the shaker into a source of digital information. Other elements included network infrastructure and a server for data processing, storage, and visualization.

,https://jpt.spe.org/methane-regulation-in-the-oil-and-gas-sector-a-primer-and-post-election-forecast,"On Day 1 of the Biden administration, 20 January 2021, President Joe Biden launched an unprecedented, whole-of-government campaign to reduce methane emissions through Executive Order 13990, “Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis.” In November 2021, the White House Office of Domestic Climate Policy detailed the campaign in its US Methane Emissions Reduction Action Plan, discussing a series of anticipated rulemakings to be issued by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Land Management, and the Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), in addition to a host of grants, partnerships, and other initiatives involving the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Energy, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. What followed was the most ambitious agenda in history to address methane emissions, including the first-ever US climate enforcement initiative. The oil and gas sector, responsible for approximately 30% of total methane emissions, was squarely in the crosshairs. On Day 1 of the second Trump administration, 20 January 2025, President Donald Trump responded, revoking Executive Order 13990. Announcing a “national energy emergency” during his inauguration speech, Trump committed the nation to “drill, baby, drill,” potentially unlocking new powers to open up drilling in protected areas. In one of 46 executive orders issued within hours of his inauguration, “Unleashing American Energy” further ordered an “immediate review of all agency actions that potentially burden the development of domestic energy resources,” directing the heads of all agencies to “develop and begin implementing action plans to suspend, revise, or rescind all agency actions identified as unduly burdensome.” “[P]articular attention” is to be paid to oil and natural gas, among other resources. At the same time, three of Biden’s signature regulations targeting methane emissions in the oil and gas sector are being challenged in the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit: the EPA’s Clean Air Act New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) and Emissions Guidelines for the Oil and Gas Sector, Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule for Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems, and Waste Emissions Charge for Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems. This article explores three key themes for the oil and gas sector: the evolution of methane regulation at the state and federal levels, a preliminary forecast of why and how methane regulation will continue, and practical ways the oil and gas sector can prepare for enhanced enforcement scrutiny. As Early as 2016, States Led the Way on Methane Regulation
According to the EPA, methane is responsible for approximately a third of anthropogenic climate change, even though it only represents 10% of greenhouse-gas emissions. Referred to as a climate “super-pollutant,” methane traps 20–30 times more heat than carbon dioxide. Methane is also an excellent and affordable fuel—cleaner than oil and coal—creating strong financial incentives to prevent releases. Recent technological advances have helped propel methane regulation, offering new capabilities to both the regulators and the regulated, including satellites that can pinpoint individual facility emissions and advanced emissions monitoring and leak detection technologies. These characteristics make methane emissions regulation and enforcement appear to be a good bang for the regulatory buck in tackling climate change. Methane regulation in the oil and gas industry is relatively new. State regulation began in Colorado in 2014 with methane emissions targets for storage tanks, separators, and leaking equipment. Colorado’s rules were strengthened in 2019 to address leak detection, tank controls, and performance standards. In 2023, the Colorado Department of Public Health and the Environment (CDPHE) issued the Greenhouse Gas Intensity Verification rule, defining how certain oil and gas facilities must calculate their greenhouse-gas intensity. The American Petroleum Institute and the Colorado Oil and Gas Association issued a statement in support of the 2023 CDPHE rule. To date, empirical evidence from Colorado suggests enhanced leak detection and prevention measures resulted in meaningful progress: In 2016, the director of Colorado’s Air Pollution Control Division reported a 75% decline in the number of sites where methane leaks were detected based on field surveys. In part because of the early successes in Colorado, traction quickly grew for methane regulation in other states. In January 2016, Pennsylvania, the second-largest producer of natural gas in the nation behind Texas, announced a four-point plan to address methane emissions. In September 2016, California released a rule committing the state to a 40% reduction in methane emissions by 2030 through continuous leak monitoring and prevention requirements, among other measures. State-level regulations likely will continue to gain momentum regardless of what occurs at the federal level. What began in traditionally blue states such as Colorado and California and in the swing state of Pennsylvania has now expanded to traditionally red states, including Texas and Utah. The Federal Seesaw: Where We Are and What Comes Next
Where We Are. The first-ever federal Clean Air Act performance standards to reduce methane were issued by the administration of President Barack Obama in 2016. The first Trump administration effectively reversed the Obama-era rule in 2020, issuing a new rule that eliminated requirements to install leak detection and monitoring technologies. The administration presented the reversal as fulfilling “President Trump’s promise to cut burdensome and ineffective regulations for our domestic energy industry.” Several major players in the industry publicly opposed the reversal, expressing concern that it would undermine their efforts to promote natural gas as a cleaner-burning fuel. NPR dubbed it the “Methane Rollback That Big Oil Doesn’t Want.” President Biden then reversed course again, announcing an ambitious climate change agenda as part of his Day 1 executive orders. The centerpiece of the Biden agenda—which far exceeded the Obama agenda on multiple fronts—was the first-ever US climate enforcement initiative. Announced as one of six National Enforcement and Compliance Initiatives for fiscal years 2024–27, mitigating climate change was listed first, as EPA’s top enforcement priority. As one facet of the EPA’s broader climate change enforcement initiative, the EPA specifically indicated its intent to use both civil and criminal authorities to address methane emissions from the oil and gas sector. A comprehensive regulatory basis for this unprecedented enforcement initiative soon followed, which would provide for the following array of new regulatory authorities upon which to pursue enforcement: The Methane Super Emitter Program was originally proposed as a backstop to other requirements in the EPA’s new methane rule. The program is designed to provide EPA-certified third-party monitors, which can include environmental nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and universities, with a role in identifying major emissions leaks. Super-emitting events are defined as those that release 100 kg of methane per hour or more. If the notification of the event by the third party to EPA is deemed complete and accurate, then the facility operator must conduct an investigation, perform any appropriate remediation, and report the results. The program is expected to encourage satellite and drone surveillance and the development and use of other mobile surveying technologies, raising public and regulatory scrutiny on the oil and gas production and supply chain.
Unlike the Methane Super Emitter Program, which is a product of EPA rulemaking, the WEC is a statutory program, and thus would require an act of Congress to repeal. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 provided new authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate methane with a requirement to impose and collect an annual charge on any methane emissions that exceed specified waste emissions thresholds from applicable oil and gas facilities. The WEC applies only to the highest emitters (i.e., those petroleum and natural gas facilities that emit more than 25,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year as reported under greenhouse-gas reporting rules). The WEC starts at $900/tonne for 2024 methane emissions, increasing to $1,200/tonne for 2025 methane emissions, and $1500/tonne for methane emissions years 2026 and later. The EPA’s WEC implementing rule exempts those entities that have been deemed to come into compliance with the new Clean Air Act NSPS and effluent guidelines for the oil and gas sector. Although concerns have been raised with respect to the effects of the WEC on energy markets, the EPA’s regulatory impact analysis concluded that the WEC and associated abatement costs will have a “negligible impact on natural gas and crude oil prices.” The EPA’s response to comments further concluded that “[t]he minimal impact of the WEC on energy markets indicates that the WEC would not have an appreciable impact on foreign imports and exports of oil and gas.” What Comes Next? President Trump has already taken steps to unwind what he views as the “harmful and shortsighted policies” of the Biden administration. Two different orders were issued to revoke Biden’s Day 1 Executive Order 13990: “Unleashing American Energy,” discussed above, and “Initial Rescissions of Harmful Executive Orders and Action.” With additional executive action inevitably to follow, Trump’s executive order entitled “Declaring a National Energy Emergency” described the prior administration’s policies as having “driven our Nation into a national emergency.” “Putting America First in International Environmental Agreements” directed the US ambassador to the United Nations to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. The withdrawal also calls into question the US signature on the Global Methane Pledge, another Biden initiative. “Unleashing Alaska’s Extraordinary Resource Potential” seeks to position the current administration to open up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling. There appears to be little question that Biden’s methane agenda will be heavily scrutinized and that there will be concerted efforts to dismantle certain aspects of it. The question presented, however, is whether, and to what extent, the Trump administration will be successful in paring it back. If there is one lesson learned from the federal seesaw, it is that each incoming administration is becoming more and more sophisticated regarding how to fortify its regulatory agenda from attempts by the next administration to destroy it. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) was enacted to strengthen congressional oversight over federal rulemakings. Congress is empowered to review certain major rules before they take effect if the review can be effectuated within 60 session days of the rule’s submission. Only a simple majority is required; the vote cannot be filibustered. Although the CRA was passed in 1996 during the administration of President Bill Clinton, it has only been used to overturn a total of 20 rules, 16 of which were overturned in a string of successes for the first Trump administration. The Biden administration also successfully used the CRA to upend the Trump administration’s replacement of the Obama-era Clean Air Act NSPS for methane. In a joint resolution issued 30 June 2021 under the CRA, Congress declared the rule to “have no force or effect,” accelerating the timetable for Biden to replace it. The Trump administration might be able to use the CRA to rescind the WEC rule issued in November 2024 and the PHMSA rule issued in January 2025, but the March 2024 Clean Air Act NSPS/emissions guidelines rule and the May 2024 greenhouse-gas reporting rule are well outside the 60 session-day window. Moreover, rescinding the WEC rule may be of limited utility given that the WEC itself was established via an act of Congress. The administration may be successful in delaying the implementation via recission of the rule under the CRA, but it will ultimately take another act of Congress to repeal the underlying legislation. In that regard, the Trump administration’s best path forward to rescind the WEC may well be an outright legislative repeal of the operative provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act. Doing so, however, would require nearly every Republican vote as well as a budget reconciliation process to obviate the need for a supermajority. This is entirely possible. The Inflation Reduction Act itself passed by a razor-thin margin via budget reconciliation with 51–50 in the Senate and 220–207 in the House. That noted, this 119th Congress has an even narrower margin in the House, with 218 Republicans, 215 Democrats, and 2 vacancies. It is expected that the Trump administration will not defend the Biden administration’s methane rules in the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, leaving environmental NGO intervenors to defend them. As noted above, three of Biden’s four methane rules have already been challenged via petitions for review filed pursuant to Clean Air Act Section 307(b)(1), with the fourth challenge likely to follow. Clean Air Act NSPS and Emissions Guidelines for the Oil and Gas Sector. More than 20 states, in addition to several other organizations, filed petitions for review. A request for an immediate stay of the rule was initially denied by the District of Columbia circuit, then again by the US Supreme Court in a one-sentence order issued by Chief Justice John Roberts on 4 October 2024. The litigation is now proceeding in the District of Columbia circuit as one consolidated case. Petitioners argue, among other things, that the Super Emitter Program amounts to an “unlawful delegation of authority to third parties” and that EPA violated Clean Air Act Section 111(d) by “imposing presumptive standards that significantly limit the States’ ability to implement Section 111(d) plans of their own design, upsetting the Clean Air Act’s cooperative-federalism balance.” Greenhouse-Gas Reporting Rule for Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems. There were multiple petitions for review filed challenging EPA’s new greenhouse-gas reporting rules. The cases have been consolidated and are now being held in abeyance for procedural reasons to evaluate potential further consolidation with prior actions. A Statement of Issues filed by petitioners indicates that one of the challenges is based on an alleged “excessive burden on small producers operating low production wells.” Waste Emissions Charge for Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems. Multiple petitions for review to challenge the WEC rule were filed on 16 January 2024, the day before it was to become effective. At least 23 states are among the petitioners. There has not yet been any substantive briefing or statements. The Trump administration can also attempt to rescind or limit the rules through new notice and comment rulemaking. Rescinding final regulations issued by a previous administration, however, takes significant time and energy. The incoming administration must provide (1) a rational basis as to why the rule should be rescinded, (2) a notice of proposed rulemaking, (3) an opportunity for public review and comment, and (4) a response to public comments. For complex rules, the process can take 2–3 years from beginning to end. Rescinding regulations can also lead to court challenges, tying the rules up in litigation and leaving them enacted while litigation unfolds. Other options include rolling back the rules. In a white paper entitled “Making American Energy Great Again,” the Independent Petroleum Association of America recommended (1) creating a new subcategory with eased standards for low-producing marginal wells and (2) giving states more leeway and time to develop plans to implement requirements for existing sources that differentiate between new and low-producing marginal wells. Regardless of activity at the federal level, improved monitoring technology will amplify citizen-led efforts to monitor methane emissions. Methane regulation has been propelled by the development of technologies allowing for the relatively easy detection of methane leaks and other emissions. As early as 2014, environmental NGOs have used sensors attached to passenger vehicles to map methane leaks on a street-by-street basis. The prevalence of cheap and user-friendly drones allows just about anyone to search for methane leaks with the right equipment and training. Now, satellites—already over a dozen in orbit—are capable of both regional mapping of methane emissions and point-source identification. Examples of well-funded citizen efforts include new satellites that can detect super-emitters, such as Tanager-1 and MethaneSAT. According to NASA, the Tanager-1 satellite recently detected a 2.5-mile methane plume emanating from a landfill in Pakistan. State agencies may continue to lean into these new technologies and provide avenues for concerned citizens and citizens’ groups to report their methane findings directly. Outsourcing data collection is also a potential means for the government to externalize the costs associated with policing methane emissions and could see adoption by states. Practical Takeaways for Proactive Companies
Proactive companies can take the following steps to become “inspection ready” in anticipation of increased state and third-party scrutiny: Current science points to the reduction of methane as a cost-effective and a relatively fast method to slow the current rate of climate change. In addition, methane reduction is touted by state regulators as protective of health for affected communities as well as capturing loss and waste of American-produced energy. For all these reasons, regardless of national politics and various challenges to EPA regulations, methane regulation is here to stay and companies should engage now to be best positioned to navigate the regulatory landscape and potential enforcement actions as it continues to evolve.

,https://jpt.spe.org/commonwealth-lng-receives-export-authorization-from-us-energy-department,"Newly confirmed US Secretary of Energy Chris Wright has granted a new export authorization for the Commonwealth LNG project proposed for Cameron Parish, Louisiana—the first major US liquefied natural gas (LNG) project to receive an export authorization for non-free trade agreement (FTA) countries since the Biden-Harris administration’s freeze on LNG export permit approvals was lifted. In January, President Trump used an executive order to lift the pause placed on new LNG permits by former President Biden in early 2024. At the time, Biden said the pause on approvals was needed so US national laboratories could study the environmental and economic effects of the LNG export industry. “President Trump has outlined a bold agenda for unleashing American energy dominance, and restoring regular order on US LNG export permits is critical for meeting this commitment to the American people,” said Secretary Wright. “Today marks one of many steps that DOE will be taking to assure our future as a reliable energy supplier to the world and resume regular order to our regulatory responsibilities over natural gas exports. Once constructed, Commonwealth LNG, owned by Kimmeridge Texas Gas LLC, will be able to export over 1.2 Bcf/D of natural gas as LNG, further cementing the US position as the top global exporter of LNG. The authorization conditionally grants Commonwealth LNG permission to export LNG to non-FTA countries from the proposed Commonwealth LNG project. In the order, DOE finds that LNG exports from Commonwealth LNG are likely to yield economic benefits to the US, diversify global LNG supplies, and improve energy security for US allies and trading partners over the course of the export term through 2050. DOE expects to issue a final order to Commonwealth LNG later this year. Separately, Commonwealth also received its draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). “With these decisions in hand, subject to a FERC Final Order, which we expect in July 2025, and DOE final authorization, Commonwealth anticipates reaching a final investment decision in September 2025, with first LNG production expected in Q1 2029,” said Commonwealth CEO Farhad Ahrabi. Once fully operational, Commonwealth LNG will be a 9.5-mtpa LNG export terminal project located on the Calcasieu River near Cameron. Kimmeridge took control of the project last June when it acquired majority ownership in the proposed project from Commonwealth LNG founder Paul Varello. According to the US Energy Information Administration’s most recent Short-Term Energy Outlook, current US LNG exports are expected to reach record highs in 2025, averaging over 15 Bcf/D. These record export levels are accompanied by record highs in current US natural gas production of almost 105 Bcf/D.

Case Study: Advanced Solutions for Complex Drilling Challenges,https://jpt.spe.org/case-study-advanced-solutions-for-complex-drilling-challenges,"While renewable energy development continues to rise, the transition from traditional hydrocarbons is not progressing as rapidly as once expected, and oil and gas is still set to be a key player in the energy mix by mid-century. There has been significant development of green technologies and increased investments in wind, solar, and hydrogen energy, but the demand for hydrocarbons continues to grow, driven by global energy demand and the complexities of transitioning entire energy infrastructures. As the world aims to balance energy security with sustainability and affordability, it is clear hydrocarbons will continue to fulfil a critical role in meeting energy demand for the foreseeable future. It will take the next 27 years to move the energy mix from the present 80% fossil/20% non‑fossil split to 48%/52% (DNV Energy Transition Outlook, 2023). Looming net-zero goals have placed operators under the microscope as they grapple with the challenge of maintaining profitability while adhering to environmental regulations. There are also increasing expectations from stakeholders and investors who are factoring environmental, social, and governance criteria into their investment decisions. Operators must now demonstrate not just financial viability, but also a commitment to sustainable practices. The drilling landscape in particular faces more complex challenges than ever before as it contends with fluctuating oil prices, more stringent environmental regulations, and increasingly complicated wells. While advances in exploration and drilling technologies have transformed the industry, unlocking previously inaccessible reserves and increasing production rates, the risk and technical difficulties associated with drilling operations have also escalated. As the sector strives to reduce its carbon footprint, advancements in drilling technologies are not only helping to minimize environmental impact, but also enabling more-efficient operations in increasingly complex well conditions. Stuck-pipe incidents are a frequent challenge during drilling operations, often costing operators millions in remediation. The remediation process is complex, frequently requiring days or even weeks of nonproductive time (NPT) and resources that may not be immediately available. Such incidents can arise from various factors, including differential sticking which occurs when pressure differences between the mud column and formation fluids cause the drillstring to stick against the wellbore wall, creating a ""stuck spot"" that immobilizes the pipe. Packoff is also a common issue where accumulated cuttings, debris, or other materials around the drillstring create a blockage. In any situation, even if partial movement is possible, circulation and rotation are often not feasible. As each stuck-pipe scenario is unique, resolving it often necessitates a customized approach. Operators frequently find themselves constrained by a lack of available solutions, limiting their ability to respond effectively to a stuck‑pipe situation. Jarring is a traditional stuck-pipe recovery method that uses mechanical or hydraulic tools to deliver sudden, high-impact forces to the drillstring to free the stuck pipe. Though this method can be effective, it is expensive and can take days or longer, which results in significant NPT to the project. If the stuck pipe cannot be resolved, the last resort is to perform a disconnect, traditionally requiring mobilization of a wireline crew to deploy an explosive charge, known as a backoff or string shot. The explosives must be detonated above the freepoint to sever the string and can leave an unpredictable fishing profile for future operation. This technique can be time-consuming, costly, and introduces a new set of risks into the operation by deploying third-party crews and transporting hazardous materials to the rigsite. During a recent project offshore Azerbaijan, an operator’s drilling assembly became stuck when drilling an 8½×10¼-in. section of a well. Despite extensive jarring attempts, the operator was unable to move the string or circulate mud in the well. This meant that operations to sever the assembly to regain circulation were required. Coretrax, an Expro company and global leader in oil and gas well integrity and production optimization, delivered its downhole circulation technology to remediate the issue. The company’s DAV MX and HyPR Holesaver had been deployed in the string as part of the customer’s wider risk assessment in case of a stuck-pipe incident. The solutions remain dormant in the string while still providing a contingency option if needed, providing an immediate remediation solution. The tools were selected as the narrow inner diameter of the drillstring components meant that traditional wireline-deployed tools were not suitable. Ahead of deploying the tools, Coretrax provided standard operating procedure documents, which were tailored for the specific rig and well conditions, meaning no additional personnel were required on site to run the tools. This enabled the operator to start corrective operations immediately when the stuck pipe occurred. Following considerable jarring activities, the operator achieved 50 gal/min of flow in the well. While this is a fraction of the circulation usually achieved, it was sufficient to enable activation of a 7-in. DAV MX circulation sub. Once activated, the sub allowed the operator to regain full circulation above the stuck point. The versatile technology is largely immune to variations in angle, temperature, differential pressure, mud type, and mud weight and has a number of activation darts to support applications across drilling, completions, or plugging and abandonment. In this case, the tool was deployed with an emergency opening ball (EOB). The EOB is used specifically for restricted circulation applications where it is not possible to pump or deploy darts to the DAV MX. The ball can be deployed in complete packoff or plugged‑string scenarios as long as the inclination of the well allows for it. The EOB was selected because the well angled at 68° which would allow the ball to gravitate down to the setting. After 2 hours, the ball successfully reached the circulating sub and full circulation was restored. The operator then deployed the 2.405-in.-outer-diameter HyPR Holesaver with the fishing dart to sever the string. Unlike conventional methods, this tool requires no explosives or other high-energy sources to deliver significant safety and efficiency benefits. When activated, the flow of ordinary mud is redirected, creating a high-velocity radial jet of fluid to erode and cut pipe in just a few hours. The fishing dart leaves clear and unrestricted access to the fish after it has cut the string free, enabling fishing of the bottomhole assembly (BHA) to commence almost immediately following cutting. Interference added to its tail also means that as the cut pipe is withdrawn it collects the fishing dart and carries it back to surface. After 30 minutes, the dart reached the HyPR sub and commenced with the hydraulic cut which was completed after approximately 10 hours of operation, and torque and overpull were applied to the string. Utilizing the technology, the team was able to successfully sever the stuck pipe, and the BHA above the severance point was successfully recovered to surface. When compared to traditional wireline methods, the application of this technology saved an estimated 2 days of rig time which is generally required for techniques involving explosives while also eliminating the need for additional specialist personnel on board. As the energy transition continues to evolve, the oil and gas industry faces an intricate balancing act: meeting global energy demands while adhering to increasingly stringent environmental regulations. This challenge is particularly evident in the drilling sector, where the complexities and risks are higher, and the margin for error smaller. Innovative technology is essential in overcoming these hurdles to enable operators to address the most-challenging drilling situations safer, faster, and more efficiently. The application of Coretrax’s circulation technology demonstrates the opportunities which can be garnered from having advanced contingency tools integrated into drilling operations. By allowing the operator to regain circulation and successfully sever the stuck pipe without the need for explosives or additional third-party crews, these technologies delivered significant time and cost savings while mitigating operational risks. By embracing technological advancements, operators can not only optimize their current practices but also contribute to the broader goals of reducing the carbon footprint and supporting a sustainable energy future.

Savvy Separator: Lessons Learned in Reusing a Separator Without Proper Design Review,https://jpt.spe.org/savvy-separator-part-4-lessons-learned-in-reusing-a-separator-without-proper-design-review,"Separation behavior has a tremendous impact on plant performance in aspects such as compressor shutdown, hydrocarbon dew point (HCDP), recycling, power demand on chillers, chemical injection, flaring, loss of revenue, and emissions. A case history of a low-temperature separator (LTS) in a mechanical refrigeration plant readapted for new conditions illustrates the importance of proper design review and verification when operational parameters change. Introduction A gas treatment facility processing two different inlet gas compositions and consisting of compression, dehydration, and LPG fractioning had been designed and built to provide sales gas with a specified dew point. As part of that treatment plant, an existing mechanical refrigeration plant (Fig. 1), was relocated and reused from another site. Filtered gas flows into heat exchangers, a chiller, and then into an LTS vessel. MEG (monoethylene glycol) is injected into the gas stream at the heat exchangers and at the chiller as a hydrate inhibitor. Liquids from the LTS flow into a three-phase flash separator where condensate and MEG are separated. Condensate is then stabilized in a reboiled absorber with hot-oil as heat transfer fluid. Fig. 2 shows a sketch of the original 44-in. ID×24-ft tangent-to-tangent (TT) vessel used as the two-phase LTS separator. The vessel has an impact plate diverter, a coalescer, and a horizontal mesh pad. The vendor indicated that it would operate properly solely based on liquid residence time considerations. Change in Operating Conditions Table 1 shows how requirements of the mechanical refrigeration plant at the previous location compare to those at the present location, with more impact on operating pressure, duty, and hydrocarbon liquid flow. Inlet composition (Fig. 3) also had a substantial change in the C2-C5 region, which impacts directly on the ability to achieve the HCDP. Plant-Reported Issues Several issues arose when operating under the new conditions including: Based on field tests and process simulation verifications, the above issues were attributed to the LTS design as follows: All these issues appear as symptoms of poor separator performance.
Review of LTS Separator Operation Analysis of the flow in the LTS separator led to the following conclusions. Liquid carryover was also estimated using a fluid properties simulator to account for the measured HCDP. Liquid carryover as a fraction of generated liquid vs. flow rate can be seen in Fig. 4. Two different gas compositions, dry and rich, are evaluated at various flow rates and temperatures, showing an increase in entrainment with gas flow rate to match the measured HCDP. Table 2 compares the results for one case run at 70 MMscf/D between the ideal case without carryover, the impact of carryover on HCDP for the actual measured case, and the impact of lowering operating temperature to try to overcome carryover. The actual HCDP was measured at 30.9°F, and the operating temperature would have had to be lowered to 8.3°F to meet the HCDP requirement. Because the client could not sell the gas without incurring quality fines, the issues needed to be solved with minimum downtime. Due to the separator's mechanical and size constraints, no changes to internals, such as the inlet device, the coalescing plates, and the demister, were advisable. Instead, a new three-phase separator was recommended to be mounted next to the existing two-phase one. New LTS Design and Performance The new design, shown in Fig. 5, allowed the proper location of new internals and the lowering of the vapor section ρv2 to values that, according to our expertise, ensure no entrainment or liquid carryover. The main upgrades included After starting the new LTS, the results were immediate. The plant reached HCDP, minimizing compression shutdown, flaring, and propane cooling power. It also reduced the hot-oil circulation rate and overall operational emissions by more than 30% (500 CO2e tons/y), the same as flaring emissions (70 MMscf each day the plant was down). Final Remarks and Lessons Learned When adapting existing equipment to a new service, it is imperative to thoroughly analyze the potential impact of different fluid properties, composition, and operating conditions. This requires a deep understanding of how these interconnected variables can significantly influence performance. While selecting appropriate internals can enhance the separator’s effectiveness, it is equally crucial to ensure that the separator's overall dimensions are well-suited. Neglecting proper sizing over solely adopting internals to minimize diameter and length is never recommended. The incorrect selection of an inlet device can hurt separation performance of an otherwise well-designed separator. Wire-mesh mist eliminators or coalescing packs should be avoided whenever the service has potential clogging issues.

Geothermal Energy-2025,https://jpt.spe.org/geothermal-energy-2025,"Over the past century, the oil and gas industry has been at the forefront of advancements in subsurface engineering, drilling, and reservoir management. These innovations, developed to optimize hydrocarbon recovery, are now being adapted to unlock the vast potential of geothermal energy. Geothermal systems, which rely on extracting heat from deep within the Earth, face many of the same technical challenges that oil and gas operators have tackled for decades. Geothermal development can be advanced efficiently and economically by applying proven oil and gas technologies. This feature reviews three studies that explore less-obvious ways in which oil and gas expertise could advance geothermal energy development. These examples demonstrate the practical overlap between the industries and identify opportunities to repurpose tools, knowledge, and infrastructure for geothermal operations. The first study investigates the use of supercritical CO2 (SCCO2) as a working fluid for geothermal energy extraction in depleted deep heavy oil reservoirs. Findings from this study suggest that this approach could provide an efficient mechanism for heat extraction and enhances hydrocarbon recovery from the reservoir. Simulations and experimental data revealed larger oil-recovery and heat-utilization efficiencies when using SCCO2. Asphaltene precipitation and permeability loss were identified as possible challenges with the approach. However, the study demonstrates the dual value of thermal energy extraction and hydrocarbon production in a bid to extend the utility of mature reservoirs. The second study evaluates the feasibility of converting existing hydrocarbon wells into geothermal district-heating assets. Focusing on case studies in Italian hydrocarbon fields, the researchers assessed the technical and economic potential of repurposing wells to meet local residential heating demands. The findings highlight that retrofitting hydrocarbon wells significantly lowers capital expenditures while mitigating mining risks. Although operational challenges such as the need for large pump-energy requirements exist, the study demonstrates how existing infrastructure can be effectively repurposed, thus offering an approach to extract additional value from hydrocarbon assets. The third study addresses the critical issue of drilling efficiency in high-temperature rock formations, with findings supported by experimental work conducted in 2021–22. The researchers conducted high-pressure/high-temperature simulations to evaluate how thermal effects influence rock drilling. They found that rapid cooling of the rock at the drill bit substantially enhanced the rate of penetration, with improvements ranging from 59 to 197% depending on the bit type and the temperature differential between the hot dry rock and the drilling fluid delivered to the bit face. These findings provide actionable approaches that could enhance drilling efficiency in geothermal wells, thereby reducing both operational time and costs. These studies collectively highlight oil and gas technologies’ contributions to geothermal energy development. Such a synergy represents an opportunity to maximize the value of oil and gas knowledge and infrastructure in addressing the growing interest in geothermal applications, ensuring that both industries remain central to meeting energy needs reliably and efficiently.

"ABB, Sage Geosystems Team Up on Geothermal Energy",https://jpt.spe.org/abb-sage-geosystems-team-up-on-geothermal-energy,"ABB and Sage Geosystems, a geothermal baseload and energy storage company, have signed an agreement to collaborate on developing energy storage and geothermal-power-generation facilities that use natural heat from the Earth to produce clean electricity. The collaboration will allow ABB to support Sage’s agreement with Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, to deliver up to 150 MW of geothermal baseload power at a location east of the Rocky Mountains in the US. The first phase of the project is expected to be operational by 2027. Within the main scope of the memorandum of understanding, ABB will investigate how its automation, electrification, and digital technology can be deployed at geothermal sites to maximize energy efficiency and reliability. This may include supplying a distributed control system, electrical infrastructure architecture, and digital solutions such as asset performance management, process optimization, and cybersecurity systems. The partnership also has the potential to develop Sage’s energy storage technology, which can be paired with intermittent renewable resources such as solar and wind. “We are focused on scaling our proprietary geopressured geothermal systems (GGS) technology, and our partnership with ABB will advance the widespread deployment of next-generation geothermal,” said Cindy Taff, CEO of Sage Geosystems. “Unlike traditional renewable energy sources, geothermal solutions, including energy storage and baseload power generation, can provide an on-demand source of clean energy that is available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.” Geothermal energy has the potential to be an important contributor to the future energy mix, with enhanced geothermal systems emitting little to no greenhouse gases. The GGS process involves pumping fluid at pressure into a man-made subsurface reservoir. After the stored water is heated to more than 150°C, it can be released back to the surface to pass through heat exchangers and turbines to generate electricity. In the US alone, it is thought that geothermal energy could capture enough natural heat resources to power more than 65 million homes. “To be able to exploit the potential of geothermal energy to enable a low-carbon society, we need cross-industry collaborations to drive advancements in the technology,” said Per Erik Holsten, president of ABB Energy Industries. “Sage’s GGS offers the ability to produce low-carbon electricity, as well as an energy storage solution, and can play an important role in the energy transition alongside other measures.” Geothermal energy is set to build on the current 0.3% market share of the world’s power supply, according to Rystad Energy. Installed geothermal capacity stands at 16.8 GW worldwide, but this is expected to reach 28 GW by 2030 and upward of 110 GW by 2050. The market growth trajectory is expected to attract investments totaling over $120 billion between now and 2035.

Shale Production and Water Reuse: A Look at Adoption and Barriers,https://jpt.spe.org/shale-production-and-water-reuse-a-look-at-adoption-and-barriers,"Few things are more essential to the now global hydraulic fracturing revolution than access to fresh water, yet this dependency use has raised environmental concerns and operational challenges. In response, oil and gas companies are increasingly turning to produced water and flowback fluids to improve sustainability. The subject has remained central at industry gatherings such as the recent SPE Hydraulic Fracturing Technology Conference (HFTC) held in the Houston area. At this year’s event, researchers from the Energy and Environmental Research Center (EERC) at the University of North Dakota presented findings that highlight both progress and limitations in water reuse. Their study found that 40% of operators in North Dakota incorporate produced water into their completions programs to some extent, with 20% using what EERC considers “significant volumes.” However, the final analysis—detailed in paper SPE 223512—revealed that only about 5% of the total water used in Williston Basin completions comes from recycled sources, with the rest sourced from fresh supplies. By comparison, the Permian Basin was found to boast a reuse rate exceeding 50%. The EERC analysis also shows that an estimated 850,000 BWPD is pumped into the subsurface in North Dakota while more than 2 million BWPD flows right back out. Almost all the state’s produced water is sent down a saltwater disposal well, with 10% used for enhanced oil recovery and just 5% reused or trucked out of state for disposal elsewhere. Researchers noted that while reuse is gaining traction in North Dakota, operators could step it up and reduce saltwater disposal injections by as much as 25%. They do face hurdles, however, including the high salinity of produced water which causes unwanted chemical reactions, and the lack of dedicated water pipelines means costs are higher. The push for greater reuse extends beyond the US. Argentina’s national oil company, YPF, is also advancing water recycling efforts in its Vaca Muerta Shale operations. A major challenge it faces is that only 20–30% of injected water returns to the surface—the rest is absorbed into the rock matrix. Despite this, YPF described in paper SPE 223566 how it developed a process to blend untreated flowback water with fresh water for completions. The company found it could incorporate up to 25% recycled water, but that this was dependent on which fracturing fluid system it was testing. The company found that fresh water-based friction reducers held up but that the produced water led to pressure variations while pumping, likely due to the fluid system’s sensitivity to anything other than fresh water being introduced. What worked best was a high-salinity polymer that was more predictable and consistent. More than that, the new friction reducer decreased YPF’s dependency on polymers which had the added benefit of reducing the dreaded “gummy bear” effect which is believed to clog up fractures and lead to conductivity loss. Another paper highlighted a niche but growing challenge faced by some US shale producers. SPE 223549, authored by researchers at NexTier Oilfield Solutions, examines the unintended consequences of using wet sand cleaned with recycled produced water in completions. The study found that washed but undried sand—highly sought after as a low-cost proppant—tends to retain higher-than-desired levels of clay, feldspar, and calcite. When mixed with friction reducers, these minerals can flocculate, or clump together, almost always impacting fluid performance and believed to harm well productivity. The salinity of the fluid also affects how these fine particles behave. As salinity increases from 4,500 to 115,000 ppm, a chemical called P-CAT makes the fine particles stick more to the proppant surfaces. Meanwhile, the fluid’s pH will shift how the particles clump together—higher pH levels favor P-CAT, while lower pH levels work better with a different chemical, P-AN1. NexTier also concluded that improving sand cleaning would further reduce fine particle levels, which is the root cause of the issue to begin with. To test the idea, the company partnered with a Texas sand mine operator to upgrade the cleaning process. The first adjustment involved reducing recycled water use from 100 to 50% in the washing stage. Next, the number of cyclones used for fines separation was doubled from one to two. The results showed an increase in quartz levels and a reduction in migrating clay from 3.5 to 1.3% among the samples. This led to a 90% reduction in turbidity, improving overall sand quality and completions efficiency. These papers underscore that water reuse in hydraulic fracturing is a complex challenge—one that’s easier said than done. However, they also demonstrate that the effort can yield significant benefits, reinforcing the need for continued investment in research to drive higher reuse rates.

Supercharging Fracs: Experts Say Combining Technologies Is the Path to Optimization,https://jpt.spe.org/supercharging-fracs-experts-say-combining-technologies-is-the-path-to-optimization,"While hydraulic fracturing technology has advanced by leaps and bounds from the first operation in 1947, opportunities exist for improvement and optimization. During the opening session at SPE’s 2025 Hydraulic Fracturing Technology Conference in The Woodlands, Texas, panelists said collaboration can help the industry overcome limitations, challenges, refine technologies to yield incremental improvements, and take advantage of the supercharging effect of combining two or more different technologies. Because hydraulic fracturing operations are so critical to a well’s performance, it’s important to realize there’s only one shot to “do it right,” Craig Miley, senior manager of drilling and completions at Ovintiv, said during the “Optimizing Hydraulic Fracturing: A Strategic Approach to Speed, Cost, and Quality” opening plenary. Over the years, the industry has gotten better at just that and doing so more efficiently. For example, Miley said, potential bottlenecks for fracturing operations include water delivery and infrastructure; sand delivery, storage, and handling; equipment expendables; and design limiters like antiquated thinking, stage architecture, and casing size versus friction. More importantly, he noted, those limitations shift over time. “Yesterday’s records become tomorrow’s averages,” he said, and predicted that in a decade, a 4-mile lateral might even be considered short Right now, Ovintiv’s daily sand demand is 20 million pounds, he said, and the company opted to use a sand pile rather than boxes or silos to ensure a steady supply. The sand pile is located to allow easy exit for delivery trucks. At the site, he said, there’s no line of trucks because “we're able to get sand off within a couple minutes.” He said being open to taking ideas from other industries can help the industry eliminate limitations in perf operations. Ovintiv took a page out of the mining industry’s book when it came to sand delivery, and as a result, the company is not having operational bottleneck issues with sand. Hess Corp. Chief Technology Officer Robert Fast said innovation is important, but the industry shouldn’t waste time reinventing the wheel. The industry has tough problems to solve, and collaboration within companies and the industry as well as across industries can help it solve those challenges, he said. “Look at those inventing the wheel you need and adopt it.” This has never been more important because the industry needs to deliver increasing amounts of quality energy at speed, Fast said. Earlier generations in the oil patch developed technologies like horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, but it wasn’t until they were brought together that they led to the shale revolution. “Why did it take 60 years to combine the two technologies to be able to achieve something truly differentiated?” Fast asked. Combining two technologies creates combinatorial effects. “One plus one does not equal two” but more like 10 or 15, as in the case of combining hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling, he said. He added, there is potential for the combination of technologies that would increase the ultimate hydrocarbon recovery from reservoirs. “15% ain’t good enough,” he said. “How do we keep getting higher and higher recoveries?” Fast said the industry could combine improved and enhanced oil recovery with concepts like augmented drainage to generate higher production. Miley said enhanced initial recovery is something Ovintiv is interested in. And Liberty Resources President and CEO Mark Pearson said one of the industry’s major challenges is achieving better effectiveness in the far field at the lowest cost possible. Time-lapse data of field drainage would also be useful, he said. On a related note, Fast said it would be valuable to have direct far-field measurements. Without direct data where it is desired,the company has sought to run available data through a physics-informed model that makes it better to optimize various systems. Hess is seeing “these proxy models match physics models,” he said. Improving the Bottom Line Pearson said one of the ways companies can improve efficiency and production is through small improvements. “What are the incremental steps we can make in our operations” that will help move the industry or company toward goals such as better far-field drainage, he asked. While improving cost and speed can impact a company’s top line, he said, making the well and completions more effective contributes more to the bottom line, representing the “biggest opportunity” in the industry. And as the industry strives to improve its metrics, Pearson urged it to think more about the future. It’s important to look beyond today's tasks and “not just be focused on doing the same thing tomorrow that we’re doing today,” he said. “I think that's how we need to keep moving.” When it comes to deploying new tech, Fast said each company should be willing to try new things because everyone can’t be a fast follower. “If everybody’s a fast follower, nobody's first,” he said.

Argonne Releases Aurora Exascale Supercomputer to Researchers,https://jpt.spe.org/argonne-releases-aurora-exascale-supercomputer-to-researchers,"The US Department of Energy’s (DOE) Argonne National Laboratory has released its Aurora exascale supercomputer to researchers across the world, heralding a new era of computing-driven discoveries. With powerful capabilities for simulation, artificial intelligence (AI), and data analysis, Aurora is expected to drive breakthroughs in a range of fields including airplane design, cosmology, drug discovery, and nuclear energy research. “We’re ecstatic to officially deploy Aurora for open scientific research,” said Michael Papka, director of the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF), a DOE Office of Science user facility. “Early users have given us a glimpse of Aurora’s vast potential. We’re eager to see how the broader scientific community will use the system to transform their research.” Exascale and AI: Boosting the Speed of Science
Aurora is one of the world’s first exascale supercomputers, along with Frontier at DOE’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory and El Capitan at DOE’s Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Exascale refers to systems capable of performing at least an exaflop—a quintillion (or a billion billion) calculations per second. The DOE machines not only are the first to reach exascale but also are currently the three fastest systems in the world. “We’re honored to be home to one of the most powerful supercomputers ever built,” said Argonne Director Paul Kearns. “The development of DOE’s exascale systems is an important step in advancing fundamental science and strengthening US leadership in high-performance computing.” Aurora has already established itself as one of the world’s leading systems in AI performance, earning the top spot on the HPL-MxP benchmark in November 2024. Its advanced capabilities for AI tasks are being used by scientists to discover new battery materials, design new drugs, and accelerate fusion energy research. Before its deployment, an Argonne-led team demonstrated Aurora’s potential by using it to train AI models for an innovative protein design framework. “A big target for Aurora is training large language models for science,” said Rick Stevens, Argonne associate laboratory director for computing, environment and life sciences. “With the AuroraGPT project, for example, we are building a science-oriented foundation model that can distill knowledge across many domains from biology to chemistry. One of the goals with Aurora is to enable researchers to create new AI tools that help them make progress as fast as they can think—not just as fast as their computations.” Among the initial projects on Aurora, researchers are working to develop high-fidelity models of complex systems, such as the human circulatory system, nuclear reactors, and supernovae, to gain new insights into their behavior. Additionally, its capacity to process massive data sets is critical for analyzing the growing data streams from large-scale research facilities such as Argonne’s Advanced Photon Source, a DOE Office of Science user facility, and CERN’s Large Hadron Collider. “The projects running on Aurora represent some of the most ambitious and innovative science happening today,” said Katherine Riley, ALCF director of science. “From modeling extremely complex physical systems to processing huge amounts of data, Aurora will accelerate discoveries that deepen our understanding of the world around us.” Collaborative Development: Building and Preparing Aurora for Science
Aurora’s deployment marks the culmination of years of collaboration. Built in partnership with Intel and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Aurora is equipped with 63,744 graphics processing units and 84,992 network endpoints, making it one of the largest supercomputer installations to date. Spanning eight rows of refrigerator-sized cabinets, the machine weighs 600 tons, covers 10,000 square feet—the size of two professional basketball courts—and is interconnected by 300 miles of networking cables. “Bringing a system of this scale to life comes with a unique set of challenges,” said Susan Coghlan, ALCF project director for Aurora. “It required working with entirely new technologies at an unprecedented scale. Seeing the machine fully operational and ready to support science speaks to the hard work and expertise of everyone involved.” To ensure Aurora was ready for science on day one of its deployment, the system was built through a collaborative process called co-design. Using this approach, the Aurora team developed the system hardware and scientific software in tandem to optimize performance and usability. This required years of collaboration between the ALCF, Intel, HPE, and researchers across the nation participating in DOE’s Exascale Computing Project (ECP) and the ALCF’s Aurora Early Science Program (ESP). While Aurora was being installed, ECP and ESP teams ran applications to stress-test the hardware while simultaneously optimizing their codes to run as efficiently as possible on the system. This resulted in dozens of scientific applications, along with a wide range of software and programming tools, being ready for Aurora before it entered production. “Part of the process of bringing a new supercomputer online involves putting it through its paces with real codes running real science problems,” said Kalyan Kumaran, ALCF director of technology. “This is key to achieving our goal of enabling science on day one of a new supercomputer’s launch.” Now that Aurora is in production, it has begun supporting over 70 diverse science and engineering projects. This includes projects from the ESP, as well as those awarded computing time through DOE’s two primary allocation programs: the Innovative and Novel Computational Impact on Theory and Experiment and the ASCR Leadership Computing Challenge.

Engineers Create More Effective Burner To Reduce Methane Emissions,https://jpt.spe.org/engineers-create-more-effective-burner-to-reduce-methane-emissions,"Researchers at the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) and the University of Michigan (UM) have published a study showing an advanced new methane flare burner, created with additive manufacturing and machine learning, eliminates 98% of methane vented during oil production. The burner was designed by UM engineering researchers and tested at SwRI. Wind blowing across conventional open flame burners can reduce their effectiveness, resulting in the release of 40% or more of methane into the atmosphere, according to engineers at SwRI. Over 100 years, methane has 28 times greater global warming potential than carbon dioxide and is 84 times more potent on a 20-year timescale. Flaring reduces overall global warming potential, but ineffective flaring dampens this strategy. SwRI collaborated with UM engineers to use machine learning, computational fluid dynamics, and additive manufacturing to create and test a burner with high methane destruction efficiency and combustion stability at the challenging conditions present in the field. “We tested the burner at an indoor facility at SwRI, where we could control the crosswind and measure burner efficiency under different conditions,” said SwRI Principal Engineer Alex Schluneker, one of the paper’s co-authors. “Even the slightest amount of crosswind significantly reduced the effectiveness of most burners. We found that the structure and motions of the fins inside the burner were essential for maintaining efficiency. The UM team engineered it to significantly improve performance.” The burner has a complex nozzle base that splits the flow of methane in three directions. The impeller design guides the gas toward the flame. This novel design allows for the even mixing of oxygen and methane and provides time for the combustion to occur before crosswinds can affect it. This design is key to the burner’s efficiency. “A good ratio of oxygen to methane is key to combustion,” said SwRI Senior Research Engineer Justin Long. “The surrounding air needs to be captured and incorporated to mix with the methane, but too much can dilute it. UM researchers conducted a lot of computational fluid dynamics work to find a design with an optimal air/methane balance, even when subjected to high-crosswind conditions.” SwRI and UM teams are continuing to collaborate on creating and testing new burner designs, aiming to create an even more efficient and cost-effective prototype in 2025.

"CO2, Natural Gas, and Hydrogen Storage-2025",https://jpt.spe.org/co2-natural-gas-and-hydrogen-storage-2025,"Two significant trends currently shaping the industry are transitioning to a low-carbon economy and integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to revolutionize design and operational processes. Transitioning to a low-carbon economy demands large-scale CO2, natural gas, and hydrogen storage. In this context, the application of AI/ML technology to uncover geochemical, microbial, geomechanical, and hydraulic mechanisms related to storage and solve complicated history-matching and optimization problems, thereby enhancing storage efficiency, has been prominently featured in recent publications. Although still in the infancy stage, hydrogen is expected to play a pivotal role in the transition to a low-carbon economy. Thanks to its abundant storage capacity and widespread distribution, subsurface hydrogen storage, especially in porous media, is crucial for addressing the spatial and temporal imbalances between supply and demand. By optimizing storage-development plans with technical and economical efficiency, AI/ML is becoming a catalyst for scaling up subsurface hydrogen storage. Carbon storage is relatively mature, with substantial knowledge gained from numerous pilot projects and ongoing commercial-scale projects worldwide. Its primary focus is leveraging the latest technologies, particularly AI and ML, to enhance performance and reduce cost through a smarter and more-automatic way of geological modeling, numerical simulation, and history‑matching. Furthermore, to cope efficiently with the dynamic demand of a low-carbon energy mix and improve overall economics, an emphasis on repurposing and multipurposing storage sites (for example, converting natural gas storage to hydrogen storage) is emerging, blurring the boundary of storage sites with different storage media. Looking forward, it is clear that the storage operations of carbon, hydrogen, and natural gas, the so-called “warehouse business” in the low‑carbon era, will become an important pillar for the global energy transition, with AI/ML accelerating the process.

Study Examines Thermal Effects on Drilling Performance in Hot Dry Rock,https://jpt.spe.org/study-examines-thermal-effects-on-drilling-performance-in-hot-dry-rock-restricted,"High-temperature geothermal resources at a distance from tectonic boundaries or geologic hotspots can be accessed by the drilling of deep wells through significant sections of basement rock. This paper evaluates the effect of rapid cooling on the rock-cutting process and incorporates this effect into a drilling-performance optimization approach. Construction of deeper wells for geothermal heat involves drilling into the basement of the continental crust. Accessing geothermal resources in impermeable igneous or metamorphic rock is referred to as drilling hot dry rock (HDR). HDR, characterized by low permeability, minimal porosity, and negligible initial water saturation, maintains high temperatures through conductive heat exchange. Accessed from the surface by conventional rotary-drilling technologies, HDR fails in compression under axial loading of roller-cone drill bits and fails in compression shear under axial and tangential loading of polycrystalline-diamond cutters (PDC) in fixed-cutter drill bits. During HDR drilling, circulated drilling fluid exits through the bottomhole assembly (BHA) into the annulus.

Offshore Drillers Remove Floating Rigs From Marketed Fleet,https://jpt.spe.org/offshore-drillers-remove-floating-rigs-from-marketed-fleet,"Offshore drillers Noble Corp. and Valaris have removed a raft of floating rigs from the market via retirements, planned sales, and reassignments. For Noble, part of the exercise came from the company’s full review of assets from its 2024 acquisition of Diamond Offshore, which recently passed the 150-day integration mark. According to Valaris, the move to retire a trio of older units came as the driller could no longer justify the cost of returning them to work. Noble has scrapped semisubmersibles Ocean Onyx and Ocean Valiant, permanently retired cold-stacked drillships Pacific Meltem and Pacific Scirocco, and reassigned drillships Globetrotter I and II to pursue intervention work. According to management, Noble is halfway to achieving the previously stated integration synergies of $100 million. “Given the oversupply of rigs in today’s market, we strongly believe that the rational course is to scrap stacked rigs or sell them into alternative use, rather than selling them as drilling units to secondary competitors,” Noble Chief Executive Robert Eifler told investors this week. “Nonetheless, these retirements will be cash flow accretive, regardless of disposal proceeds, as we expect to shed upwards of $20 million in annualized stacking costs.” Noble said that the Globetrotters could be open to marketed work in specialty areas such as the Black Sea, but the current plan is to use the rigs to chase opportunities in the intervention market. “We continue to believe those rigs are well suited for that market and we also believe that that market will be a strong and growing market going forward,” said Noble Chief Financial Officer Richard Barker. “So, in the near term, we’ve got several open, I'd say, conversations for multiyear work that actually could use both of the Globetrotters that's in the intervention market. If for some reason we're having trouble contracting into that market, then later in the year we'll make a decision about whether to further reduce costs on one of those units.” The planned divestment of the Pacific Meltem, a seventh-generation rig built in 2014, did catch a few onlookers in the financial community off guard. The relatively young rig is cold stacked at Las Palmas, Canary Islands. Noble’s Eifler told investors that when they weighed options, and with the diminished call in the near term for stacked capacity, they do not see a scenario where it would be activated in the next 2 to 3 years. That fact, plus the cost of cold stacking, drove the decision to divest the unit. “We failed to see a likely scenario where it would make sense for us to bid that rig, especially considering that the contract durations that we see today and that we think we'll continue to see for a little bit now, given the softness, are short enough, where in effectively any situation where we would bid that rig, we would be bidding it against available active fleet within our own fleet,” said Eifler. “So, we took the decision, which we think is the right decision to go ahead and move on.” Valaris has retired semisubmersible VALARIS DPS-5, which has been idle since last working in third quarter 2024, as well as sister units VALARIS DPS-3 and VALARIS DPS-6, which have been stacked for several years. The company expects that these rigs will be removed from the global drilling supply and repurposed for alternative uses or scrapped. “We are committed to prudently managing our fleet and will retire or divest rigs when the expected future economic benefit for an asset does not justify its costs,” said Valaris Chief Executive Anton Dibowitz. “Consistent with this approach, we have decided to high-grade our fleet by retiring three semisubmersibles: VALARIS DPS-3, DPS-5, and DPS-6, for which we see limited attractive, long-term contract opportunities. These actions reduce costs for idle rigs, benefit our cash flow, and further focus our fleet on high-specification assets.” In addition, the company sold jackup VALARIS 75 for $24 million. VALARIS 75 is a 25-year-old jackup that has been stacked in the US Gulf for 5 years. As part of the purchase and sale agreement, future operations are restricted to the US Gulf.

Methodology Prevents Drillstring Fatigue and Failure in Deep Well With Large Shallow Dogleg,https://jpt.spe.org/methodology-prevents-drillstring-fatigue-and-failure-in-deep-well-with-large-shallow-dogleg-restricted,"Fatigue-induced failure is recognized as the primary cause of tubular twistoff. Repeated cyclic bending loads and stress caused by dogleg severity, pipe weight, and buckled drillpipes can result in drillstring fatigue and failure. The complete paper deals with the incidence of seven twistoff accidents in large shallow-dogleg sections in three deep wells with a true vertical depth (TVD) of greater than 5000 m. The authors propose a methodology for preventing drillstring fatigue and failure in deep wells with large shallow doglegs. Three deep exploration wells with TVD of greater than 5000 m have suffered from repeated (two or more) twistoff incidents in large shallow-dogleg sections while drilling.

Drilling Automation and Innovation-2025,https://jpt.spe.org/drilling-automation-and-innovation-2025,"Everywhere you look these days, there is talk of how advances in big data, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) will revolutionize virtually every aspect of our lives. The thought of letting computer algorithms pore over mounds of data collected every day and spit out solutions to our biggest problems is certainly appealing. This month, we will look at how researchers in the drilling domain are using this potential to improve well construction. I would be remiss if I did not caution the reader to maintain some healthy perspective when looking at how other areas have been changed and assuming that a direct analog exists for drilling. Consider this: It is estimated that there are fewer than 100,000 wells drilled each year, meaning that more data is generated by traffic in a small city in a day than is produced by the entire global drilling industry each year. Suffice it to say, while AI and ML are powerful tools that will certainly effect change, one should not expect off-the-shelf solutions to simply be plug-and-play for revolutionizing drilling. Instead, it will be careful application of these tools combined with a strong grounding in the fundamental physics and engineering of the domain that will lead to meaningful progress. I urge readers to keep this in mind as they peruse the selection of papers for this month. Each takes a different approach to how problems are solved with data and algorithms, but they all share a common thread: There must be a solid foundation in domain knowledge to build a successful solution.

Mastering Produced-Water Management in Deepwater GOM: 25 Years of Insights—Part 2,https://jpt.spe.org/mastering-produced-water-management-in-deepwater-gom-25-years-of-insights-part-2,"This article is the second of a two-part series and covers four themes: equipment, process configuration, operations, and effluent quality. Part 1 included an introduction, a brief description of six major themes for produced-water treatment system design, and a more detailed discussion of two themes: the characterization of feed produced water and chemical treatment. This article includes Part 1’s abstract, and the Conclusion section of this article addresses both Parts 1 and 2. Abstract This two-part series provides guidelines for the systematic design and operation of produced- water systems specifically for deepwater Gulf of Mexico (GOM) platforms. Six elements or themes are highlighted: fluid characterization, chemical treatment, equipment, process configuration, operations, and effluent quality. The characteristics of the incoming produced water, together with the target effluent quality, define the water-treating challenge. Due to the high cost of space and weight in the deepwater environment, water treatment must have high intensity and must be highly integrated with surrounding equipment. High intensity refers to equipment that can manage high volumetric flow rates, over short residence times, and which occupies a small footprint. The concept of highly integrated system design refers to system process design that integrates water-treatment equipment, process configuration, and chemical treatment into a high-performing single system that removes a very high fraction of the contaminants (mostly oil suspended in water). Every opportunity is utilized to ensure that the produced water is treated to a high standard. Peak shaving, interface bleed, and break tanks that act as clarifiers are just a few of the opportunities that can be utilized to improve produced-water quality. Equipment Fundamental information is provided to assist the design team to select equipment for treating produced water to meet regulatory guidelines for overboard water disposal. This includes primary and secondary deoiling equipment—hydrocyclones and flotation cells (Walsh, Arnold, and Stewart). Primary separation equipment (separators, hydrocyclones) depends on density difference, contaminant (droplet and particle) size, and fluid viscosity. Secondary (flotation) performance depends on contaminant size, interfacial adsorption (which depends on the contaminant chemistry and chemical treatment), bubble size, and total surface area of the bubbles (gas/water ratio). Tertiary separation equipment (such as filters, membranes, etc.) depends on contaminant (floc) size, media surface properties (which depends on the contaminant chemistry and chemical treatment), media surface area, superficial velocity, and details regarding backwash etc. In the deepwater GOM, the design objectives are met largely through customized design, mainly of hydrocyclones and flotation. These technologies are considered to be “conventional” since they have been available for decades. However, detailed design features of these conventional technologies are not well-known and have only come to light through After Action Review and examination of best practices across the region. For hydrocyclones, higher pressures (about 150 psig) at the inlet are required for greater flexibility in adjusting operating parameters such as pressure differential ratio and reject ratio for optimal liner efficiency. Custom design features include small-diameter liners (for greater forward pressure drop and separation efficiency), staging of the throughput (0.25/0.5/ 0.75) has been used with success, and large reject port (for peak shaving). These features can be incorporated into the well-known conventional hydrocyclone. For flotation, a wide range of approaches have been used to meet design objectives. Customization of flotation equipment includes methods for creating a large number of small-diameter bubbles; number of stages in the equipment design; injection/inline mixing of flotation chemicals; and valving and pipe flow design to minimize shearing. Through performance analysis, the design of single-stage flotation has been found to be inadequate for deepwater application. The separation efficiency of tertiary equipment will not be discussed in this article because it is generally not required to meet overboard regulatory water-quality specifications and is not normally used in offshore operations. 1.   Hydrocyclones—Primary Deoiling Equipment Hydrocyclones are regarded as “standard technology” in offshore operations for the removal of dispersed oil droplets from produced water and have been successfully used onshore as well. The oil-removal efficiency of a hydrocyclone is the difference between the oil-in-water (OiW) levels of the inlet stream and the water outlet stream divided by the OiW in the inlet stream (Walsh, Arnold, and Stewart). 1.1       Driving Force for Separation Hydrocyclones utilize liners to generate high centrifugal forces (1,000–2,000 G, where G is the gravitational constant) to classify the influent oil/water stream by density. Large centrifugal forces are generated by inducing a swirl motion to the fluid inside the liner. The angular acceleration due to the swirl motion enhances the effect of the density difference between the dispersed oil droplets and water. The oil, being lighter than water, migrates to the axial center of the liner. This core of oil flows in the opposite direction of the water effluent due to pressure difference between the feed and the reject orifice. As shown in Fig. 1.1, the oil is directed to a reject port (overflow), and the water exits through an effluent port (underflow in Fig. 1.1). The reject core is drawn out of the reject orifice at the top of the cyclone liner. A modified Stokes’ Law equation for separation of oil droplets from water applies. V0 = Fc * 1.78 * 10-6 (Dr) d2 /µ Where Fc is the centrifugal force, multiples of gravity, V0 is the vertical velocity of the oil droplet in ft/sec, d is the droplet diameter in microns, ∆ρ is the specific gravity difference between water and oil, and µ is fluid viscosity in centipoise. The migration rate of the oil droplets to the central core (or axis) is controlled by the same variables in Stokes’ Law with one exception. Stokes’ Law is based on gravity as the driving force whereas in a hydrocyclone the centrifugal acceleration of the swirl motion provides the driving force. Various Liner Sections A liner has four sections—a cylindrical swirl chamber, a concentric reducing section, a fine tapered section, and a cylindrical tail section (Figure 1.1). The location between concentric reducing section and taper section is the point of cyclone size specification (hydrocyclone diameter). Fluid acceleration (tangential velocity) occurs in the reducing, taper, and parallel sections. The reducing and taper sections have a conical shape, and the parallel section has a cylindrical shape. Packaging of Liners Most offshore hydrocyclone installations have a pressure vessel that houses many liners (Fig. 1.2). The most common packaged unit has a single feed stream and a single product and reject stream. Packaging is an important aspect of hydrocyclone installation. Manufacturers have developed many varieties of packaging which have various desirable features. The design team will need to review various packaging to select the most appropriate for the design project. It is important to select a reasonable number of liners in each pressure vessel (such as between 50 and 60). Based on operational and maintenance considerations, it may be useful to select the number of liners in each pressure housing to process roughly 25% of the total produced-water rate or a maximum of about 50,000 BWPD. It may be advantageous to provide a spare pressure vessel to be used when one of the vessels with liners is out of service for maintenance, especially in offshore operations. 1.2    Operating Principles 1.2.1 Separation, Capacity, and Equipment Cost Separation efficiency depends strongly on the diameter of the liner. The smaller the diameter, the lower the liner throughput capacity, but the higher the swirl velocity and the greater the driving force for oil/water separation. Lower capacity means more liners will be required for a given water flow rate, and subsequently, equipment cost will be higher. In deepwater operations, droplet size is very small because of excessive shearing and limited room for long pipe runs to allow droplet coalescence. Based on this, smaller-diameter (high-efficiency) liners are preferred. That is one of the basic decisions that will need to be made when selecting the liners. The curves in Fig. 1.3 were generated for different liner sizes based on empirical correlations for a specific set of density difference and water viscosity. Differences in these variables will change the results but not the overall conclusions. For deepwater offshore operations, smaller-diameter hydrocyclones (such as 10 mm or 25 mm) are preferred to remove small-diameter (<20 microns) dispersed oil droplets. 1.2.2 Flow Rate and Hydrocyclone Separation Efficiency (Operating Envelope) Turndown Ratio. As shown in Fig. 1.4, the separation efficiency of a hydrocyclone typically increases as the flow rate increases and remains constant over a wide range of flow rates. At a certain high flow rate, the separation efficiency starts to drop rapidly. The hydrocyclone designs from each manufacturer have their unique curve. The curves in Fig. 1.4 show a turndown ratio which is approximately 4 to 1. For operational purposes, it is best to use the hydrocyclone at 80% of its maximum rated flow rate to handle fluid rate fluctuations from slugging generally observed in operations. Pressures Three pressures are important to the optimization of fluid flow and separation efficiency in the hydrocyclone: (a) forward or inlet pressure, (b) treated effluent or underflow pressure, and (c) reject or overflow pressure. Underflow pressure is a function of the inlet pressure and volumetric flow rate of liquid through the hydrocyclone, which creates a pressure drop. In a typical installation, the hydrocyclone is connected to a separation vessel with the level-control valve of that vessel downstream of the hydrocyclone. Thus, the inlet pressure is the pressure in the vessel and the underflow pressure becomes the upstream pressure to be used in sizing the vessel’s level-control valve. The difference between the inlet pressure and the underflow pressure is called the forward pressure drop. The importance of the forward pressure drop cannot be overstated yet it is often specified incorrectly. This pressure drop should be maximized since it provides the driving force for separation. The inlet pressure is provided by an upstream separator or a suitably (low-shear) selected pump and is the highest of the three pressures. For design purposes, it is preferred that this feed pressure is greater than about 125 psig or preferably around 150 psig. High inlet pressure pushes the fluid through the liner, generating high centrifugal forces. Low pressure in the fluid core permits the reverse flow of the oily water to the reject port (reject orifice). The reject port is a very small orifice that is about 1–3 mm in diameter. This is designed to ensure that the hydrocyclone reject rate is small and only the fluid from the central oily core flows in the direction of the overflow. Overflow pressure is controlled by external valves and the valve-control system. Reject Ratio. The ratio of the reject or overflow rate to the inlet flowrate is called the reject ratio. It is modulated by adjusting valves on the overflow and underflow discharge piping. Reject Ratio = (Overflow rate/Inlet flow rate) * 100 Hydrocyclone systems have an optimum reject ratio. Systems operating at less than the optimum reject ratio will result in lower oil removal efficiency. A margin of safety may be determined by quantifying the decline in removal efficiency as a function of the reject ratio. In most cases, this reject ratio is about 2.5. Dispersed particles in the oily reject stream can result in plugging of small reject orifices (about 2 mm) and impact oil-removal efficiency. This can be corrected by periodic backflushing of the reject orifices. Pressure Differential Ratio (PDR) PDR = (Pinlet – Preject) / (Pinlet – Pwater outlet) Pinlet is the inlet pressure, Preject is the pressure at the reject port or Poverflow, Pwater outlet   is the pressure at the water outlet stream or P underflow. For oil and water separation, the optimal PDR is between 1.7 and 2.0, and the exact PDR will need to be determined during operation. PDR must be greater than 1 to force the oil in the core to go in the reverse direction of flow. For a given hydrocyclone geometry, the PDR controls the amount of fluid that is rejected. Fig. 1.5 provides insight into the relationship between the PDR, reject flow rate, and the separation efficiency. The figure on the right is the relation between the reject ratio and the PDR. Fig. 1.5 shows the relationships between two particular hydrocyclone designs. Performance Data. Field data for hydrocyclone performance on the Auger platform in 2004 is presented in Fig. 1.6. The data shows that the primary benefit of the hydrocyclone is to significantly reduce the oil concentration downstream of it (peak shaving). This can significantly improve the performance of the downstream water-treatment equipment such as flotation cells. The gradual deterioration of hydrocyclone performance (squares) that started in October 2004 was due to a reduced backwash frequency and lower flow rates without adjustment of the number of liners. 1.3. Hydrocyclones—Advantages and Drawbacks 1.3.1 Advantages 1.3.2 Disadvantages 2.   Flotation Cells—Secondary Deoiling Equipment In this section, we briefly describe the basic information that the design engineer should consider for selection of flotation equipment for a given application. We do not describe details of various types of flotation equipment but simply present guidelines that will assist design engineers in selecting equipment. Flotation is a secondary process. If hydrocyclones are present in the system, flotation is always located downstream of the hydrocyclones. Flotation is typically capable of separating small amounts of oily solids along with dispersed oil particles and thereby increases a system’s efficiency. Gas flotation equipment is generally more efficient in dispersed oil removal when compared with liquid-liquid hydrocyclones because of its ability to remove both dispersed oil droplets and at least some oily solids. Flotation units utilize finely dispersed gas bubbles to carry dispersed oil droplets and oily solids to the surface. Oil droplets and oily solids adhere to the surface of the bubbles and rise to the surface with a velocity that is estimated from Stokes’ Law. The attachment of dispersed gas bubbles to the oil droplet and oily solids reduces the specific gravity, thereby producing a faster rise and accelerating their separation. Chemicals are used to coagulate and flocculate the dispersed droplets. Gas bubbles and flocculated droplets form a froth layer on the water surface, and contaminants on the surface are removed by skimming. 2.1       Mechanism of Separation In a flotation cell, gas bubbles are injected or induced. Gas bubbles rise rapidly and collide with the oil drops. The collision frequency depends on the concentration of oil drops, the concentration of gas bubbles, and on the projected areas of the oil drops and the gas bubbles. Very few collisions lead to the capture of oil drops by gas bubbles. This is known as the “capture efficiency.” This is roughly 1/1000. It is important to note that capture efficiency is much smaller when large bubbles are used when compared with the capture efficiency when small bubbles are used. Capture efficiency depends on the surface chemistry of oil and gas. It is strongly affected by chemical additives such as coagulants and flocculants. Fig. 2.2 is a schematic showing the impact of gas-to-water ratio and bubble size on collision frequency and capture efficiency. For improved separation of dispersed oil droplets from produced water in a flotation cell, small bubbles and high gas/water/oil ratio are needed. 2.2       Design Considerations Flotation is a contact separation process. It relies on the contact of gas bubbles with oil drops and solid particles. The important variables are: Design variables include large contaminant oil droplets and oily solid particles, uniform bubble distribution throughout the flotation cell, high gas/water ratio, and small (optimal size) gas bubbles. The bubble size should be minimized while ensuring that the bubbles are large enough to migrate to the oil/water interface. The contaminant size can be increased via chemical usage such as coagulation and flocculation. These chemicals are injected downstream of the hydrocyclones but upstream of the flotation cells. The use of multiple stages in a flotation cell is a very effective way of increasing the separation efficiency. For example, in most applications, horizontal hydraulically and mechanically induced flotation cells routinely use four separation stages. The total fluid residence time in a flotation cell is about 5 minutes.
In addition to the aforementioned variables, there are a few important practical considerations in the mechanical design. As with most water-treatment equipment, integration of the flotation unit into a facility or process is critical to successful performance. The most important aspect of integration is handling the reject. 2.3       Flotation Equipment There are four types of gas flotation cells that are used in the upstream oil and gas industry (Walsh Arnold, and Stewart). Almost all horizontal units are multistage. We do not provide any details on the equipment but will simply highlight some features that can help design engineers in selecting the most appropriate unit for the application. 2.3.1    Dissolved Gas Flotation (DGF) Unit In a DGF, gas is dissolved into a recirculating recycle clean-water stream (about 20– 25%) at high pressure (around 20–40 psig). Natural gas is generally used to exclude oxygen. The gas- saturated water then passes through a valve and into the flotation chamber. The dissolved gas breaks out of the solution in small-diameter bubbles (20 to 60 microns) when the flow enters the chamber. These bubbles are much smaller than in a typical induced-gas device which are approximately five to 10 times larger. Dissolved gas generally is between 0.2 to 0.5 scf/bbl of water to be treated. The amount of gas that can be injected into a DGF is limited due to two factors. The first is a thermodynamic limitation of gas solubility that depends on the temperature of the water and pressure of gas. The second factor is the practical limit in how much treated water can be recycled to inject the gas into the feedwater. Although small bubbles are generated in the DGF, the total number of bubbles is relatively small because of the limitations of volume of the injected gas. So, in most cases, the overall separation efficiency is around 50%. DGFs can be single or multistage units. DGFs are not commonly used the upstream oil and gas industry because of low separation efficiency. 2.3.2    Horizontal Hydraulically Induced Flotation Unit In these units, gas dispersion is achieved by circulating a portion (about 25%) of the clean effluent water in each cell section. This water re-enters the flotation cell through a venturi which draws gas from the vapor space over the water in the cell and discharges it with the water into the bottom of the cell. These hydraulic units are mostly four cells. The capacity of the unit must be designed to handle the feed (untreated influent) plus the recirculated water. 2.3.3    Horizontal Mechanically Induced Flotation Units (Such as Wemco) These units achieve gas dispersion with a rotor turned by an electric motor. As the rotor turns, it acts as a pump forcing water through a disperser and creating a vacuum which pulls gas from the gas blanket into a standpipe and mixes it with water. As the gas-water mixture moves through the disperser, small gas bubbles form. The gas bubbles thus formed gather the oily floc and bring it to the surface where it is skimmed off. In general, the efficiency of a mechanically induced gas flotation cell is higher than the hydraulically induced cell. However, due to higher maintenance costs associated with multiple motors and rotors, hydraulic units are often preferred over mechanical units. 2.3.4 Staging and Removal Efficiency As mentioned before, horizontal flotation units are generally multistage. In a four-cell unit, the total fluid retention time is typically 5 minutes. Bulk water flow moves in series from one cell to the other by underflow baffles. Water flow from one cell to the other is basically in a plug flow mode. Flotation kinetic analysis has long been used to predict the contaminant removal efficiency in an IGF (induced gas flotation) process. Based on this analysis, efficiency is a direct function of the cell residence time and the number of cells (Movafagian et al). Fig. 2.3 is based on the kinetic analysis. It shows that in a single cell unit, the maximum contaminant removal efficiency is about 70%, even if the fluid residence time is increased to 2.5 minutes. The design engineer should take this into consideration. 2.3.4 Vertical Induced Gas Flotation Units (VIGF) VIGFs (typically single stage) were originally designed to address concerns about the effect of wave motion on deepwater floating structures, to reduce footprint, and as a lower-cost alternative to the large multistage horizontal units discussed above. VIGFs have performed well; however, single-vessel applications can be prone to upsets, offering no redundancy or protection against mechanical failure. When vertical flotation units are required to meet system design or space limitations, the use of two or more vessels in series should be considered because of low efficiency for single-cell units as shown in Fig. 2.3. Currently, the main advantages offered by vertical IGF are low cost and reduced space requirement and weight. Gas bubbles in a typical VIGF are generated either by using eductors (hydraulically induced such as in a Unicell), or in some designs, specialized pumps are used to generate gas bubbles. However, in all these VIGFs, single stage is used and the fluid residence time varies between 2 to 5 minutes. The vertical configuration lends itself to the use of vessel internal elements that promote uniform distribution of gas, good gas bubble/oil drop contact, and coalescence of oil drops. This has led to sophisticated internal elements, which make these units significantly different from the classic horizontal IGF units. A major disadvantage of using coalescing elements is their tendency to become plugged by suspended solids present in produced water. 2.4       Flotation Cells—General Performance Guidelines 2.5       Flotation Cell Advantages and Disadvantages Advantages Disadvantages 3.   Process Configuration Process configuration refers to the process flow diagram, i.e., the sequence of tanks and vessels, connections and routing of process flows, and the all-important routing of reject streams. Many different process flow diagrams could be devised for a given project. Variations include use of degassing vessels, design of closed drain system, pumps, valves, instrumentation that provides motive flow, and control of levels and fluid flow are all part of the process configuration. In the design stage of a project, the development of a process configuration is known as process integration. Generally, no piece of equipment should be selected until the impact of that equipment on the overall process has been determined. The design team evaluates various process flow diagrams and finally selects the one that is most appropriate for the project (Walsh). A process flow diagram (PFD) which is a composite of systems on various GOM platforms is shown in Fig. 3.1. Hydrocyclones and flotation cells are used for oil/water separation. It is important for the design team to take into consideration some of the best practices for removing dispersed oil from produced water during selection of the most appropriate design for the facility. These best practices include: We focus on the rejects-handling system only because of issues that we have observed in properly handling the rejects in many existing facilities. From the standpoint of overall system, the reject is a recycle stream. It represents an endless list of possible process problems in terms of compatibility, contamination, flow-rate fluctuations, and so on. If not managed properly, it can cause the entire system to struggle in many ways and cause poor effluent water quality. All water-treating equipment generates a reject stream. In many cases, it is desirable to route the reject stream through the primary separation process. In selecting equipment and designing an oil/water separation system, it is important to consider the flow rate and oil-in-water concentration of all reject streams. A material and flow balance of the overall process is required. If the primary separation equipment is not adequately sized to manage both the reject and the primary production stream, then the system will be bottlenecked. Realistic values of reject rate must be used in sizing the vessels which will manage both the reject and the primary production stream. If the vessels are not properly sized, the operators will be forced to reduce either the oil-retention time, the water-retention time, or the reject flow rate. Any one of these steps will result in poor oil and/or water quality. On a deepwater offshore platform, there are typically only three discharge streams—dry-oil pipeline, dry-gas pipeline, and treated produced water for overboard discharge. In Fig. 3.1, a cone-bottom slop tank is shown for managing the reject stream. Fluids from the slop tank are recycled back into the process stream. It is important to properly design the slop tank to minimize process upsets. This tank can be used to provide settling time and another opportunity for chemical treating. Provisions should be provided for heating the fluids to a temperature of 120°F or higher for improved separation into oil/water/solids. 4.   Operations Input It is extremely important that the design team has very good participation from the operations representatives in all phases, starting with the conceptual design and ending when the design team hands over to operations. Operations representatives have enormous practical experience in operating the facilities and can provide very valuable input on what works and what needs improvement (Walsh). They can provide excellent input, especially in the following areas. Operations participation will greatly facilitate the handover of the facility operation from the design team to operations. 5.   Effluent Produced-Water Quality for Overboard Disposal Governmental regulations govern the water-quality parameters needed for overboard disposal. For example, in the US federal waters (designated legally as the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS)), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) created the Clean Water Act (CWA) in 1972, which then created the NPDES (The National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System) permitting program. Overboard disposal of produced water in the GOM must be authorized by a permit issued under the NPDES program and must meet regulatory guidelines detailed in the permit. We briefly describe these guidelines below. The critical dilution concentration calculated from Table 1 of the permit depends on the discharge rate, discharge pipe diameter, and the water depth between the discharge pipe and the bottom. The NOEC is defined as the greatest effluent dilution which does not result in lethality, compared to the control sample.
Produced-water sampling methods, sampling frequency, sample preservation, and analytical techniques for sample analysis, toxicity testing, and reporting requirements are detailed in the NPDES permit. The reader should refer to the NPDES permit for details. 6.    Conclusions Major conclusions from Part 1 and Part 2 are summarized below. 1. Six elements or themes are the basis for the systematic design of produced-water-treatment systems for offshore GOM platforms. These themes are fluid characterization, chemical treatment, equipment, process configuration, operations, and effluent quality. 2. The characteristics of the incoming fluids, together with the effluent quality, define the water-treating challenge. 3. In most cases during the design phase, data on produced-water chemistry, dispersed oil and suspended solids concentration, and particle size distribution data are not available. 4. Analog systems must be identified through knowledge of surrounding reservoirs. Produced-water characteristics from analog fields/reservoirs should be adjusted based on the information from reservoir engineering, process engineering, and flow assurance from the field under design for developing an understanding of produced-water characterization for design purposes. 5. Produced-water quality and volumes vary during the field life. The system design should ensure that these variations are adequately managed. 6. Good-quality sampling points both upstream and downstream of all stages of separation equipment should be provided for effective monitoring and troubleshooting of equipment during field life. 7. Sampling probes should be installed in accordance with best practices to ensure representative samples can be taken in an environmentally acceptable manner. They should be readily accessible and easily retrievable. 8. Chemical-injection points should be installed to inject chemicals with a focus on product/effluent quality, flow assurance, and asset integrity in accordance with best practices. 9. Injection points should have injection quills or nozzles to ensure proper mixing with the fluid stream. These should be readily accessible. The injection quills or nozzles should be easily retrievable on-line. 10. Chemical selection should be based on laboratory testing with simulated produced-water chemistry (used for system design) and should preferably be done simulating process-design temperature and pressure. 11. Hydrocyclones and flotation cells, commonly used as primary and secondary deoiling equipment in deepwater offshore operations, are well suited for produced-water treating. Hydrocyclones Flotation Cells 12. It is critical to properly design a slop tank to handle the rejects stream. Design should include provisions for hauling of the separated solids for onshore disposal and for recycling of the emulsion pad directly to the sales oil line to minimize process upsets and deoiling-equipment performance.
13. Design of a produced-water-treatment system should consider the rate of the recycle streams from the slop tank and the quality of the fluids being recycled. 14. Operations representative should be a member of the design team, and the input on best practices and lessons learned from design and operation of previous facilities should be carefully considered by the design team for improved facility design. 15. Design teams should base their facility design on meeting the effluent treated produced-water quality as required by governmental regulations.

Geothermal Exploitation Achieved by Injection of Supercritical CO2 Into Deep Heavy Oil,https://jpt.spe.org/geothermal-exploitation-achieved-by-injection-of-supercritical-co2-into-deep-heavy-oil-restricted,"After thermal flooding, deep heavy oil reservoirs retain plenty of heat and oil. Supercritical CO2 (SCCO2) emerges as an optimal heat-carrying fluid and enhances heavy oil extraction because of its high mobility and unique thermal properties. A comprehensive model of geothermal exploitation for depleted deep heavy oil reservoirs using SCCO2 injection is described in the complete paper. In recent years, the development of many deep heavy oil reservoirs has been completed using steam huff ’n’ puff. However, the substantial contrast in physical properties between steam and heavy oil intensifies the occurrence of viscous fingering.

Workflow Enables Technoeconomic Optimization of Underground Hydrogen Storage in Aquifers,https://jpt.spe.org/workflow-enables-technoeconomic-optimization-of-underground-hydrogen-storage-in-aquifers-restricted,"Serious concerns exist about the economic feasibility of underground hydrogen (H2) storage (UHS) in aquifers. The authors’ objective is to investigate the use of an optimization workflow to maximize both H2 storage and net present value (NPV), consequently obtaining an optimal reservoir development strategy. An aquifer storage system for H2 typically consists of a brine-saturated formation layer, injection and withdrawal wells, and surface pipelines. The injected gas is divided into cushion gas (usually H2 or another gas) and working gas (H2). The main purpose of the cushion gas is to maintain sufficient minimum pressure, while the working gas is aimed at temporary storage and later production and sale. During UHS, the working gas is injected into the subsurface and then mixed with the formation fluid and extracted in a cyclical manner.

Fostering Future Leaders: The Impact of Mentorship on Women in Leadership,https://jpt.spe.org/fostering-future-leaders-the-impact-of-mentorship-on-women-in-leadership,"According to recent studies by McKinsey & Company, PwC, and O.C. Tanner, fulfillment at the workplace takes the lead nowadays as the most important metric that most employees strive to achieve in the corporate world over benefits and pay [1,2,3]. Tailored mentorship programs are one of those powerful tools to attain fulfillment. Therefore, developing robust mentorship programs has become more important than ever due to the paradigm shift observed in employees' career aspirations. The benefits of mentorship, specifically for women, are backed by empirical evidence from various studies and surveys. According to a report by the Lean In Foundation and McKinsey & Company, women who have mentors are more likely to be promoted, ask for more challenging assignments, and aspire to senior leadership positions than women who do not [4,5]. Another study by KPMG found that 28% of women who had mentors at the workplace became senior leaders, compared to 19% of those without mentors [6]. Mentorship programs not only provide women with the necessary tools to excel in their roles but also help bridge the gender gap in leadership roles. This was the main message of a panel discussion hosted last year by the SPE Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) Committee. The panel featured two female leaders and D&I advocates in our industry: Celina Gioja (founder and CEO of Celi Gioja and a mentor and champion of Vital Voices in the Neuquén province in Argentina) and Emily Firth (Europe market and business analyst at Halliburton, and the global mentoring chair for Halliburton’s Women Sharing Excellence Employee Resource Group). Gioja and Firth shared their personal and professional experiences with mentorship, as well as their tips and advice for both mentors and mentees. The panelists also discussed the challenges and opportunities for women in the energy industry, and how mentorship can help create a more diverse and inclusive culture. The panel was moderated by Miral Tawfik, lead reservoir engineer at Chevron and external outreach chair of the SPE D&I Committee. This article distills the key discussion points and adds context to the main messages shared during this SPE Live session. A diverse and inclusive workplace is an integral part of the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) framework. Creating a workplace where all employees feel valued and respected, regardless of their background, is a key part of the “S” in ESG [7]. This includes implementing policies and programs that promote diversity, setting diversity targets, and providing DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) training. Implementing those practices not only ensures fulfillment and success on the employees’ side, but it has been proven to foster innovation, creativity, and employee engagement, which delivers better business results. The business case for a more diverse corporate pipeline has been backed by multiple studies and reports over the past few decades [1]. Companies with more than 30% representation of women are more likely to financially outperform those with less female representation [4]. Besides the strong business case for inclusion, adequate representation in leadership positions is very important. Another great aspect of mentorship is it helps generate role models for other women in the organization, where more junior female employees in the company can see that it is possible to reach leadership positions. As Gioja notes, women represent only 24% of the total workforce in the energy industry and 19% of energy leadership positions. This may be a result of the barriers and challenges women face to reach and maintain those leadership positions. Those challenges start as early as childhood. Firth shared the “dream gap” theory, which is the phenomenon of girls as young as 5 years old starting to doubt their abilities due to societal pressures. It describes the disparity between a young girl’s aspirations and her perceived ability to achieve them. The challenges persist into adulthood as Gioja points out, listing the glass ceiling, the unconscious biases, the maternity tax, the gender pay gap, and illegal harassment/discrimination workplace culture as typical experiences of female professionals [8–13]. A challenge Firth elaborates further is unconscious bias. An example was demonstrated in a 2012 study where the authors sent identical applications to multiple institutions to have them assessed for a given job opening, with the only difference between these applications being the name of the applicant. Some of the applications were submitted as the name “John,” and some were submitted as the name “Jennifer.” Results showed that the likelihood of hiring the candidate was 18% lower when the applicant had a female name, and institutions were 12% less likely to mentor that female, and wanted to offer them 13% less in salary compared to the male counterpart despite the education, experience, and skills mentioned on the resumes being identical [14]. Those headwinds not only act as barriers of entry; they also have been shown to discourage retention among women employees. Acknowledging that those headwinds exist is the first step towards remedying the diversity gaps in the workplace. Another step is to develop tailored mentoring programs that target women’s development, as well as programs that target employers and male allies. Training employers on bias is key to spreading awareness of the effect of metacognition on decision making. Research has shown that mentoring helps address how to navigate challenges. It helps with talent retention, removal of cultural barriers, defending against discrimination, internal leadership development, and overall employee workplace performance [15–19]. It is important to note that most of the time women go through those challenges alone. Through mentoring programs, experienced women professionals can share their stories to normalize talking about those headwinds, support each other, and share lessons learned on how to navigate and overcome those barriers. Moreover, since many energy companies are international in nature, it is important to understand the regional differences in gender representation, and tailor the training programs accordingly [20]. As Gioja states, it’s important to make the challenges visible, take action to reduce their impact, and emphasize that the importance of DEI is not a matter of opinion, but a fact backed by several studies. The success of mentorship programs is multifaceted. When enhanced with best practices, like strategic matching of mentor and mentee, mentor program training, and program flexibility, women mentoring programs help women to, as Firth says, “play to their strengths.” Women display strong innate abilities for effective communication, empathy, leading by example, and fostering the team towards group success. One tip that Firth offered is to make sure there are clear objectives to the mentorship program, following the SMART approach. More importantly, mentees should reflect on what they want to get from the program by identifying the skills that they wish to develop in the short and long term, while maintaining some flexibility to adjust the goals as necessary. A few questions a mentee needs to answer are: In response to how to measure the success of women mentorship programs, Gioja offered several methods. Both Firth and Gioja emphasized the significant role that male allies play in the success of those programs. Fostering a safe space for everyone to ask questions and better understand the data on this issue is crucial. Firth added, “We want them to be conscious about hiring women, building teams that include women, and inviting women to the table … We want our male role models to be advocates for women, and not just when they are in the room, but pulling up their name when looking for people who are interested in getting involved in other projects or careers or training opportunities. And we want to see men included on panels and at events that relate to women’s issues. We want to see that active allyship.” For Further Reading [1]Diversity Matters Even More: The Case for Holistic Impact by Dame Vivian Hunt, Sundiatu Dixon-Fyle, Celia Huber, et al., McKinsey & Company.

Model-Reduction and Data-Assimilation Approach Enhances Carbon-Dioxide Plume Tracking,https://jpt.spe.org/model-reduction-and-data-assimilation-approach-enhances-carbon-dioxide-plume-tracking-restricted,"Addressing climate change through carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies requires advanced computational methodologies for subsurface carbon-dioxide (CO2) storage monitoring. This study focuses on the Illinois Basin Decatur Project (IBDP), a CCS demonstration pilot aimed at CO2 injection into a deep saline reservoir. A novel framework combining dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), a data-driven model-reduction technique, with direct data assimilation is introduced to streamline the calibration of CO2 plume evolution models. This approach enhances rapid tracking and overcomes the computational challenges of traditional high-fidelity numerical reservoir simulations known as the full-order model (FOM). DMD represents a superior approach for flow in porous media compared with most reduced-order models because of its ability to capture complex flow dynamics effectively.

Production Monitoring-2025,https://jpt.spe.org/production-monitoring-2025,"Oilfield operators are paying more attention to monitors, sometimes in real time. Checks and balances are critical to make sure that primary production monitors facilitate a wealth of useful information and knowledge that justifies capital and operational expenditures. This additional surveillance is certainly tied to deploying more sensors and gathering more data. Credit is due to the rapid pace of applying data analytics to deal with large amounts of continuous data. Today, the dependence on primary monitors is higher than ever, so much so that orchestrated efforts are underway to make these nearly foolproof. Often, direct measurements are supplemented with model predictions. Also notably visible are the efforts to integrate multiple perspectives of sustained production. In the pursuit of consistency and reliability for multiphase flow meters (MPFMs), paper SPE 222068 demonstrates an example of how to monitor remote metering. This essentially advocates monitoring of production monitors. As more subsea MPFMs are deployed to monitor extended assets, these need to be monitored systematically. Such a burden does not have to be overwhelmed by the influx of huge amounts of data. As such, dynamic verification of the output of sensors is ensured by using various intelligent techniques so that the gathered additional data leads to meaningful outcomes when the MPFMs operate within their operating envelopes. Continuous, accurate knowledge of production rate and pressure is important not only for field surveillance but also for effective production optimization. A hybrid approach of integrating physics-based and machine-learning models for bottomhole pressure and rate prediction is presented in paper SPE 218762. The benefits of this approach have been reported with the capability of reproducing missing or filler data during infrequent measurements of production rate and pressure. Recognizing the questionable reliability in some cases of flow profiles in horizontal wells captured by production-logging tools, paper URTeC 4054832 presents advanced thermal-hydrodynamic modeling. This rigorous simulation, designed specifically for horizontal wells, helps determine the contributions of fractures and the matrix to a well subject to complex fluid circulation inside and outside the liner. The papers presented for additional reading also show a similar trend in production monitoring.

Effect of Thermal Interference Explored in Offshore HP/HT Gas Field,https://jpt.spe.org/effect-of-thermal-interference-explored-in-offshore-hp-ht-gas-field-restricted,"Field X is a large greenfield high-pressure/high-temperature (HP/HT) carbonate development offshore Malaysia. The current development plan requires each of the wellhead platforms (WHPs) to host multiple high-rate gas wells. When closely spaced wells produce simultaneously, they can perturb the local geothermal temperature profile and can affect the thermal response of individual wells, the platform pile and conductor strengths, and infill well designs. The complete paper outlines a technique to evaluate formation temperature shifts when closely spaced wells are produced concurrently and apply that to validate the design basis for new development. Field X features reservoir pressure of greater than 10,000 psi and temperatures near 200°C. The reservoir also contains high levels of sour contaminants (CO2 and hydrogen sulfide). The current development plan requires multiple wells producing simultaneously at a high gas rate from a single WHP. Flowing wellhead temperature (FWHT) can reach 170°C under these flowing conditions. The typical well in the subject field accesses a gas-bearing reservoir where the maximum bottomhole temperature is nearly 200°C. Each producer well is designed to produce gas with a high rate of 200 MMscf/D with expected FWHT of up to 170°C. The development team investigated the following effects of thermal interference: The analysis conducted during this study estimated the following parameters for the design: The complete paper includes a discussion of multiwell thermal interaction. In a producing wellbore, energy is exchanged between the wellbore and the formation.

"Petrobras Achieves Record 800,000 B/D at Búzios, Targets 1.5 Million B/D by 2030",https://jpt.spe.org/petrobras-achieves-record-800-000-b-d-at-buzios-targets-1-5-million-b-d-by-2030,"Petrobras announced this week that production at its Búzios field offshore Brazil has reached a record 800,000 B/D following the startup of its sixth floating production, storage, and offloading (FPSO) unit, the Almirante Tamandaré. The field, located in the pre-salt Santos Basin about 180 km off the coast of Rio de Janeiro, is the second largest in Brazil by production volume and reserves, following the Tupi field. Búzios began production in 2018 and is host to five other FPSOs. “This major production milestone is the result, above all, of the tireless efforts of teams from different areas of Petrobras. The company is committed to producing sustainably, seeking to apply new technologies. We are aware of the responsibility we have in providing energy to help move the country forward. Therefore, we celebrate this record, aware that we need to continue on this path, developing our reserves and seeking new exploratory frontiers,” Petrobras CEO Magda Chambriard said in a statement. The Almirante Tamandaré, which came on stream 15 February, has the largest production capacity in Brazil’s offshore sector, capable of processing 225,000 B/D of oil and 12 MMscf/D of gas. Petrobras expects Búzios to hit 1 million B/D soon as the FPSO Almirante Tamandaré ramps up to full capacity. The FPSO is connected to a subsea production and injection system via umbilicals and risers, connecting 15 subsea wells. The project includes gas lift, gas and water injection, and the potential for future gas transfer. Petrobras took delivery of the vessel in October from a Chinese shipyard. The company plans to expand to at least 11 FPSOs as it targets 1.5 million B/D by 2030. The next project will center on a 180,000 B/D FPSO, set to produce via 14 subsea wells, with operations expected to begin next year. Búzios set its previous daily production record in January 2024 at 782,000 B/D, with Petrobras noting that it surpassed 750,000 B/D for more than 20 days over the year. In March 2024, the field hit 1 billion bbl of cumulative production 5 years after first oil was achieved. Petrobras received the 2020 Offshore Technology Conference Distinguished Achievement Award for its advanced technologies that addressed challenges such as ultradeepwater conditions, subsalt reservoirs, high pressure, and high CO2 content. The company credits the innovations to greater efficiency, higher production, and reduced operating costs. Búzios hosts Brazil’s most productive wells, with reservoirs located 1700 to 2100 m below the seabed. The pay zone, nearly 400 m thick, is comparable in height to Rio de Janeiro’s Sugarloaf Mountain. Petrobras is the operator of Búzios with an 88.98% interest alongside partners CNOOC (7.34%), CNPC (3.67%), and Pré-Sal Petróleo SA (PPSA) as the project manager.

LNG Demand To See 60% Growth as Global Energy Mix Shifts,https://jpt.spe.org/lng-demand-to-see-60-growth-as-global-energy-mix-shifts,"Despite global liquefied natural gas (LNG) supplies growing by only 3 mtpa last year—the lowest annual increase in a decade—a new report from Shell predicts demand will rise to between 630 and 718 mtpa by 2040, a 60% increase above current levels. According to Shell’s annual LNG outlook published this week, economic growth in Asia is a key driver behind the projected surge in demand. As the continent—and other parts of the world—continue adopting cleaner fuels, the supermajor expects more than 170 mtpa of new LNG supply to be available by 2030. LNG is increasingly considered an attractive source of energy due to its cost-effectiveness and its ability to lower emissions in shipping, road transport, and hard-to-electrify industrial sectors, according to the London-based oil and gas company. Longer term, Shell said that existing gas infrastructure around the globe could be repurposed to import bio-LNG, synthetic LNG, and green hydrogen. But the report also notes that investments are lagging in comparison with energy diversification ambitions, particularly in Europe and Japan which must step up LNG imports in the coming years to meet emissions goals. China is also depending on LNG to meet increasing domestic energy needs by building out more import capacity and adding piped gas connections to supply 150 million people by 2030. India is progressing at a slower pace but plans to build new infrastructure to connect 30 million people to gas lines over the next 5 years. ""Upgraded forecasts show that the world will need more gas for power generation, heating and cooling, industry and transport to meet development and decarbonization goals,” Tom Summers, senior vice president for Shell LNG marketing and trading, said in a statement. ""LNG will continue to be a fuel of choice because it’s a reliable, flexible, and adaptable way to meet growing global energy demand."" Looking Back At 2024 Global LNG shipments reached 407 mpta in 2024, marking a year-over-year increase of only 3 mpta. Shell said construction delays and declines in domestic gas production in key exporting countries, including Nigeria, Malaysia, and Russia, limited supply growth. The Middle East led long-term LNG contracting in 2024, while the US, already the world's largest LNG exporter, continued expanding its capacity to account for one-third of global supply despite increasing regulatory scrutiny and emissions concerns. Early 2024 saw LNG prices fall to their lowest level since 2022, but prices bounced back by midyear due to delays in the development of new supply capacity. In the first half of 2024, demand for LNG in Asia strengthened as China took advantage of lower prices, importing 79 mtpa last year. Imports in India also grew, increasing 20% to 27 mtpa, as the country bought record volumes to help meet greater power demand due to hotter weather in early summer. While LNG continued to play a vital role in European energy security in 2024, imports fell by 23 mtpa, due to strong renewable energy generation and a limited recovery in industrial gas demand. However, the expiration of Russian pipeline gas contracts to Europe via Ukraine, coupled with cold winter temperatures and low wind power generation at the end of the year, drove strong storage withdrawals that increased prices. LNG supply growth is coming, but Shell noted that the timelines of newly proposed LNG projects remain uncertain due to multiple developmental challenges, including geopolitical tensions, regulatory hurdles, startup risks, and supply chain bottlenecks. Despite these concerns, Shell's research suggests growth is inevitable, with China, India, and Europe all showing strong demand signals.

New BP Wells Boost Gas Production in Egypt’s West Mediterranean Offshore,https://jpt.spe.org/new-bp-wells-boost-gas-production-in-egypts-west-mediterranean-offshore,"BP’s two newly completed gas wells at the Raven field offshore Alexandria in Egypt’s underdeveloped West Nile Delta (WND) area, following subsea commissioning, will offer a much-needed boost to the country’s flagging gas production. Egypt’s Ministry of Petroleum reported that the Valaris DS-12 drillship expedited infill drilling at Raven in mid-January, completing the campaign 3 months ahead of schedule. The ship has moved to the King area where BP is exploring for gas in the Lower Miocene, expecting results in late February, according to Egypt’s state information service. Raven is the fifth of five fields brought on stream since 2017 in the North Alexandria and West Mediterranean Deepwater offshore concessions as part of the WND development to supply gas to Egypt’s domestic market. BP’s newest wells, West Raven-4 and West Raven-5, are expected to increase the field’s production by 200 MMcf/D of gas and 8,000 bbl of condensate in 2025, according to Egypt’s Ministry of Petroleum. Energy Crisis Upsets LNG Exports Cairo wants to reverse gas production declines that hit record lows in 2024, causing electrical blackouts and a government shakeup that led to the appointment in July of a new minister of petroleum. As the energy crisis pushed Egypt’s LNG imports to their highest levels in 6 years, the country had to again shelve its ambitions of creating an Eastern Mediterranean LNG export hub and instead import LNG to supply domestic demand. BP (82.75% operator interest) and European independent Wintershall Dea (17.25% working interest) partner in WND which includes 25 wells and three deepwater long-distance subsea tiebacks to shore, designed to eventually deliver 900 MMscf/D of gas at peak and 30,000 B/D of condensate. Prior to BP’s Raven wells, Shell brought online two of three wells drilled in late 2024 as part of Phase 10, adding 86 MMcf/D to production at its West Delta Deep Marine project, and bringing the project’s total output to 286 MMcf/D. In addition, Eni plans to begin infill drilling at the Zohr gas field by the end of January to boost production. On the Exploration Side Egypt plans to get back on track with its long-term LNG export strategy by boosting exploration. To that end, it has earmarked 15 new agreements (covering a minimum of 46 wells) for signing in 2024 and 2025 that offer up to $20 million in signing bonuses on minimum investment commitments of $748.5 million, the African Energy Council reported. On the exploration side, ExxonMobil already struck gas in January at its Neferatari-1 exploration well in Egypt's frontier Herodotus basin which the US Geological Service estimated could contain 286 Tcf of technically recoverable gas resources. ExxonMobil spudded Neferatari-1in December 2024 in the North Marakia Block 5 miles offshore—its first-ever Egyptian wildcat. Its partner QatarEnergy bought a 40% working interest in the block from the US supermajor in March 2022. QatarEnergy on the March In January, QatarEnergy announced that it was expanding its Egyptian footprint with an agreement to acquire a 23% working interest from Chevron in the North El-Dabaa (H4) block, 10 km offshore in water depths ranging between 100 and 3000 m. Chevron holds a 40% operator interest in North El-Dabaa (H4); other partners include Woodside (27%) and Egyptian state-owned Tharwa Petroleum Co. (10%). “This agreement demonstrates our commitment to the oil and gas sector in the Arab Republic of Egypt and further strengthens our partnership with our valued partner Chevron,” Saad Sherida Al-Kaabi, the Minister of State for Energy Affairs, the President, and CEO of QatarEnergy, said in a news release. In November 2024, Chevron drilled the Khendier-1 exploration well, also in Herodotus basin, but later declared a dry hole, according to regional energy media. Chevron is awaiting approval from Cypriot authorities for its latest plan to develop the offshore Aphrodite field, with gas directed to Egypt.

Guest Editorial: 2025 Perspective: Digital Transformation in Oil and Gas—From Evolution to Shockwave,https://jpt.spe.org/guest-editorial-2025-perspective-digital-transformation-in-oil-and-gas-from-evolution-to-shockwave,"In June 2019, before the seismic shift brought by the OpenAI revolution, I authored a JPT guest editorial on the oil and gas industry's digitalization journey. I emphasized the transformative roles of the industrial internet of things (IIoT), cloud computing, and artificial intelligence (AI). Now, reflecting on that editorial from the vantage point of 2025, it is remarkable to witness how many predictions have materialized and how the industry has evolved beyond expectations. ¹ A Sudden Acceleration: The AI Shockwave in Oil and Gas For nearly 3 decades, technological advancements in the oil and gas industry followed an evolutionary trajectory. Each breakthrough—2D and 3D seismic imaging, horizontal and directional drilling, semisubmersibles, and permanent sensors such as microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and nanotechnology—built upon prior successes, driving incremental gains in efficiency and recovery. The ability to acquire real-time downhole data has ushered in the ""sense-compute-act"" era, fundamentally transforming reservoir management. However, these advances followed a measured pace, allowing engineers time to integrate new methods with traditional workflows. Then, in a span of just 20 months, the industry was hit by a technological shockwave. The AI revolution—accelerated by OpenAI’s breakthroughs—upended long-held paradigms. No longer do companies rely solely on downhole measurements from oilfield service providers. Instead, they now train AI models on decades of historical data to predict maximum efficient rate (MER) and expected ultimate recovery (EUR). The “old world” of deterministic modeling is rapidly giving way to probabilistic AI-driven decision making. This abrupt shift is not just about automation; it is redefining the fundamental principles of reservoir management. The industry finds itself grappling with uncertainties inherent in AI predictions, challenging engineers to place trust in models that are not explicitly programmed but instead learn patterns from vast data sets. The rate of technological change is outpacing our ability to fully comprehend its implications—a stark contrast to the controlled evolution of past innovations. From Data Collection to Intelligent Systems: The Rise of Metaknowledge In 2019, I introduced the concept of metaknowledge—understanding what we know and don’t know—as more critical than primary knowledge—the ability to discern what we know and what we do not. Today, this has become an essential component of digital transformation. AI no longer just processes data—it determines which data is meaningful, distinguishing signal from noise within the vast repositories of information. Where traditional methods relied on human-driven interpretations, AI models now identify patterns and anomalies at scales beyond human capability. The ability to extract actionable insights from billions of data points has eliminated many inefficiencies in field operations. More importantly, it has reshaped the role of engineers, shifting them from manual interpreters to strategic AI curators who validate and refine machine-generated insights. From Static Models to Living Digital Twins Reservoir models were once static representations, periodically updated with new data. Today, the distinction between data at rest (archived information) and data in motion (real-time sensor readings) has blurred into a continuous feedback loop. Living digital twins—which integrate AI, real-time sensor data, and historical archives—now provide dynamic, real-time updates of reservoir behavior. These systems self-correct based on new measurements, drastically improving predictive accuracy. Production forecasting, once constrained by static assumptions, has become a fluid, adaptive process capable of responding to subsurface changes as they occur. The AI Revolution in Reservoir Management: From Measurement to Prediction The shift from measurement-based to prediction-driven reservoir management is among the most profound transformations in the industry’s history. This transformation is already reducing operational costs while maximizing extraction efficiency. However, challenges remain—engineers must develop new skills to interpret and validate AI-generated models, ensuring that machine predictions remain aligned with the physical constraints of reservoir physics. The Future: AI, Robotics, and the Next Leap in Oilfield Automation While much of the industry’s AI transformation has focused on subsurface modeling, the next frontier will bring automation into physical operations. The ultimate vision is an autonomous oilfield, where AI-driven systems monitor, predict, and optimize operations without requiring continuous human oversight. However, achieving this requires an essential balance between automation and human intuition—a principle the industry cannot afford to overlook.
The Competitive Landscape: AI, Energy Transition, and the Role of Oil and Gas While AI is revolutionizing oil and gas operations, it is also reshaping the broader energy landscape. The global push toward renewables, battery storage, and hydrogen is intensifying competition for capital and resources. However, the transition away from fossil fuels will not be immediate. Oil and gas will remain indispensable for the foreseeable future, not just as an energy source but as a foundation for industries from petrochemicals to transportation. The key challenge is sustaining operational efficiency while preparing for a gradual shift toward cleaner alternatives. AI will play a dual role in this transformation. The industry’s long-term competitiveness will depend on how effectively it embraces digital transformation while positioning itself within the evolving energy mix.
Final Thoughts: The Path Forward— The AI revolution is reshaping oil and gas faster than any prior technological shift. The industry is no longer in a period of incremental change—it is in an era of fundamental reinvention. The companies that thrive will be those that The path forward is not just about automation—it is about augmentation. AI is not replacing human expertise; it is amplifying it. Those who master this balance will define the future of oil and gas in a rapidly evolving energy landscape.

Experimental Investigation of Factors Affecting Oil Recovery and Displacement Efficiency of Carbon Dioxide Injection in Carbonate Reservoirs,https://jpt.spe.org/experimental-investigation-of-factors-affecting-oil-recovery-and-displacement-efficiency-of-carbon-dioxide-injection-in-carbonate-reservoirs,"Miscible gas injection is the most widely applied enhanced oil recovery (EOR) method in light oil carbonate reservoirs as a tertiary and secondary method. Miscible gas has high displacement efficiency and usually results in a low residual oil saturation (Sorm) in the parts of the reservoirs that are in contact with the gas. Accurate determination of Sorm and understanding the parameters that affect displacement efficiency are crucial for successful miscible gas EOR projects. In this paper, we present a comprehensive experimental program designed to investigate the effect of several parameters on oil recovery, displacement efficiency, and Sorm of miscible and near-miscible carbon dioxide (CO2) injection. The parameters investigated in this study are the experimental pressure, pore volume (PV) injected, injection rate, rock type, and initial water saturation (Swi). The coreflood experiments were performed using live crude oil at pressures starting below the minimum miscibility pressure (MMP) to pressure well above the MMP, using reservoir core samples of up to 1 ft long and 2 in. in diameter. All CO2 injection experiments were performed using vertically oriented cores, with gas injection from the top to ensure stable displacement. The experimental results show that (1) oil recovery decreases as pressure decreases with Sorm increasing by more than 20 saturation units as the pressure decreases from 4,250 psi to 2,700 psi; (2) CO2 breakthrough was much earlier at lower pressure, which leads to more CO2 recycling and potentially lower CO2 sequestration volume; (3) the recovery factor is strongly affected by the PV injected, and this effect is much more significant for the experiments performed at lower pressure; (4) the injection rate has an insignificant effect on oil recovery and Sorm for miscible or near-miscible CO2 because of the low interfacial tension between oil and CO2; (5) rock heterogeneity has a strong effect on oil recovery and CO2 breakthrough and, hence, on CO2 recycling and economy of the projects; and (6) the presence of mobile water at the beginning of CO2 injection resulted in lower displacement efficiency and increased Sorm. However, this water blocking effect should be determined experimentally for a given reservoir rock/fluid system. The results of this study cannot be generalized for other reservoirs. The results of this study have important implications for the design and performance predictions of CO2 injection in the reservoirs under study. Starting CO2 injection at reservoir pressure, which, in some cases, is more than 1,500 psi above MMP, is recommended because of its superior displacement efficiency and less CO2 recycling because of later breakthrough. However, a higher pressure may negatively affect the required CO2 volume, the compression cost, and project economics. This abstract is taken from paper SPE 218525 by S. K. Masalmeh, ADNOC; S. A.

Biogeochemical Modeling of High-Pressure/High-Temperature Bioreactor Systems for Enhanced Microbial Risk Assessment in Underground Hydrogen Storage,https://jpt.spe.org/biogeochemical-modeling-of-high-pressure-high-temperature-bioreactor-systems-for-enhanced-microbial-risk-assessment-in-underground-hydrogen-storage,"Underground hydrogen storage (UHS) can be a valuable solution for efficient and environmentally friendly energy storage, but it introduces complex microbial and geochemical interactions that pose unique challenges. This research leverages advanced biogeochemical modeling to accurately replicate these interactions, reproduced within a laboratory-scale bioreactor system that mimics the high-pressure and high-temperature conditions typical of many underground gas storages. Using a dual-platform approach, we used COMSOL Multiphysics and CMG-GEM, augmented by supplementary simulation tools like PHREEQC, to perform an in-depth analysis of the evolution of microbial populations and gas and liquid composition and of the hydrochemical processes in geological formations. Our comparative study demonstrates the effective application of these platforms in modeling the complex dynamics of heat and fluid dynamics, mass transfer, and biochemical reactions. The models were meticulously validated against experimental data, displaying high accuracy in kinetic parameter fitting and the ability to replicate the observed phenomena, including microbial hydrogen consumption rates below 0.05% under specified conditions and no detectable H2S production at high pressures. The simulation results from COMSOL and CMG-GEM showed remarkable agreement, with differences in the respective outcomes under 3–5%, confirming the reliability and robustness of the simulations across different computational environments. The research highlights the benefits of integrating multiple simulation platforms to achieve a comprehensive and comparative understanding of biogeochemical processes at various scales. This approach not only enhances our predictive capabilities but also facilitates the transfer of biochemical and geochemical kinetics from bioreactor-scale to reservoir-scale models to make the implementation of hydrogen storage possible. These findings underscore the potential of the modeling tools to support the assessment and management of microbial risks associated with hydrogen storage, contributing to fully assessing the storage feasibility. By providing a detailed comparison of two leading software platforms, we established an essential methodological framework for advancing the UHS technology toward safe implementation.
