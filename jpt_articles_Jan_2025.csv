Immersive Experience: VR Revolutionizing Oil Workflows,https://jpt.spe.org/immersive-experience-vr-revolutionizing-oil-workflows-restricted,"The oil industry has long flirted with virtual reality (VR) and visualization tech but falling prices and technological advances mean this once-futuristic concept is becoming more practical. The tech is appealing because oil companies have struggled to visualize complex subsurface data and effectively train their workforce. VR’s immersive nature is helping companies overcome such challenges. Physical space has long been a constraint when it comes to analyzing core samples at the YPF Technology (Y-TEC) research facility in Berisso, Buenos Aires. Ariel Guzzetti, lab and data manager for the subsurface services department at YPF Technology, told JPT the lab can display up to 500 linear m of physical core at any given time. Core projects tend to take between 4 and 8 months to complete because during those projects specialists require frequent access to the cores. Sometimes the facility displays optical electronic microscope images, CT scans, log plots, charts, and other data related to the cores on laptops, monitors, or printouts near the cores, such as for workshops or training sessions. “That’s how we run out of space,” he said. The facility can handle somewhere between five and eight projects simultaneously. “We usually have three, five, seven projects on hold, and not due to the capacity of our lab. Maybe we can do more tests, but we run out of space to lay out the cores,” he said. Finally, Guzzetti said, people frequently travel to the Buenos Aires facility to work with the cores, which can be inconvenient or costly. But virtual space is a different story: Enter the “miniverse,” a small virtual universe, in this case dedicated to geoscience. With VR, it’s possible to “bring people to the rock instantaneously,” he said, and displaying relevant data is much easier. “With this technology, you can mix up the rock and the data together without the restriction of laptops or TV screens. You can display as much information as you want, all in the same area.” With VR, experts can access and examine the cores, consult existing core data, and interact with other experts to study the samples. Core images, scans, and other information can be used to recreate the core digitally so it can be studied and interacted with in a virtual environment. Currently a geologist can see the structure, fractures, and facies in the core. Guzzetti emphasized that the virtual core is not the same as a digital twin of the core. “For core description, it does not replace the actual core. It’s more for analyzing data and seeing bigger structures,” he said. But he believes a digital twin future will be here soon, with virtual cores providing higher-resolution details. For now, though, Y-TEC is testing VR technology and plans to deploy its use within the +VacaMuerta consortium. “We are going to give a VR headset to every consortium member,” he said. “We can even coordinate to do meetings in the virtual reality so they will not need to come to our lab to see the rocks.” Working in the miniverse requires the use of a VR headset, and Guzzetti has been testing the Meta Quest 3 and Quest 2 versions. “In order for this technology to really grow up, we need more headsets in the market,” he said. Working with VR headsets doesn’t come naturally to everyone who may need to use one, but they can learn how to work the equipment fairly quickly, he added. “Most of the people who try it need only 5 to 10 minutes to realize how to operate inside the virtual reality. In fact, what we are doing right now is if someone needs to use it, we give him the VR headset for a weekend and encourage them to try it” using entertainment software, Guzzetti said. “Within a couple of days alone or with our assistant, in 5 to 10 minutes, they are already using the system.” He enjoys witnessing the responses of people new to VR. “It’s amazing to see the first impression when people who don’t use virtual reality and haven’t before tried this kind of technology. We introduce how to use it, and they always say, ‘Wow! I can see the core’ in virtual reality. The first impression is always a ‘Wow!’” While learning to operate in VR using a headset may not take too long, some people cannot tolerate being in a VR environment for extended periods of time. “Some people get dizzy and are not comfortable using the helmet for long periods of time,” Guzzetti said. Limiting use to shorter periods can be helpful, or those individuals can work in mixed reality rather than full VR, he said. Robin Dommisse, senior 3D geomodeling advisor for the Bureau of Economic Geology (BEG) at The University of Texas at Austin, said immersive technology has evolved from the “status symbol” visualization rooms that companies were spending big dollars on at the turn of the century. Those rooms—meant to enable collaboration and decision making—tended to be larger auditoriums with expensive projectors that showed 3D images on a static screen for users to view through 3D glasses. Such rooms fell out of fashion as companies sought solutions more conducive to collaboration. One solution that is rising in popularity is the combination of immersive software and a VR headset. Multiple users equipped with VR headsets can gather in a virtual room to examine cores, and in these rooms, they have access to outcrop data along with subsurface data like well logs, 3D seismic, and models. “Think of it as a transition from a standard 2D PowerPoint presentation to an interactive, 3D visual collaboration space that integrates all your geological, geophysical, and engineering data and serves as a decision-support environment,” Dommisse told JPT. Being able to see inside the rock enables geological analysis that helps bridge understanding from outcrops to the subsurface data, he added. Integrated 3D visualization software like BaselineZ, which BEG uses, puts the digitized core data into a virtual space on a virtual table so a user can scroll, investigate, and interpret thousands of feet of core data for multiple wells in the same VR space. Users can see important rock attributes like porosity and permeability, and the software allows for the visualization of reservoir simulation results, such as to reflect various stages of a waterflood project, he said. “You see a reservoir simulation fluid front pass through a reservoir with each time step between injectors and producers. And of course, then you can expand that to other forms of enhanced oil recovery,” Dommisse said. “It’s a real interesting way to combine not just the multiple subsurface data, but also combine the engineering interpretation together with the geological interpretation.” While visualization and simulation are critical, he said major value comes from such an environment being able to support decision making. The more accessible and easy to use the decision support tool is, the more value it can provide, he said. “I think that virtual reality is going to play a much more important role in that in the future,” he said. “You don’t just bring the data together just to study it or to analyze it, but actually to use it for a real-time decision making in exploration and development scenarios. If you can do that, then, no matter how much a tool would cost, it would quickly pay for itself.” Dommisse sees use for such tools beyond decision making at oil and gas companies. With VR technology, geology students or busy engineers—no matter where in the world they are—can take a virtual geological field trip to the same place at the same time to learn more about outcrops and the subsurface. People from all around the world could sign into a particular virtual room and their avatars would be present for a meeting, lecture, or tour. “It is a really big advantage if you want to either teach a number of students in multiple locations, or you want to bring expertise together from multiple locations in the world, looking at the same sort of images, models, three-dimensional displays, and so on,” Dommisse said. “We see an incredible value for training, education, and interaction.” Even those without base-level knowledge in a topic can benefit from VR sessions. “We’ve also done this with people who effectively have zero interest in the actual subject matter. Let’s say, if you bring somebody who’s not a geologist, like me. You invite them to a room, and they see all this type of unfamiliar stuff. For some reason, people engage more,” he said. Seeing things in 3D makes everything easier to understand because human brains are adapted to quickly analyze complex 3D scenes, he said. “If you look at something as esoteric as a well with a well log with three-dimensional seismic with surfaces, with faults, all these typical types of geological things, when you see them in true 3D, even a layperson, a person who’s not an expert, can understand what these objects are. They see planes, they see cross sections, they see surfaces, they see maps.” He’s seen VR efforts fail over the years, he said, and it finally seems like everything is coming together to help move VR technology into the mainstream. “All of the technologies have kind of come together to create a perfect storm where everything becomes much, much more affordable. I tell people regularly that if you want to get into virtual reality for the oil and gas industry, all you need to do is buy a 3-year-old version of the Meta Quest 2, which now is down to $200, and then you can download tools like the BaselineZ viewer for free,” Dommisse said, although he noted BaselineZ collaboration rooms are also accessible via viewer software running on a smartphone, tablet, or laptop. “The person who creates the room pays for the room. I can invite a large number of people to my room to educate them, to interact with them, and so on. It’s really the most affordable time in history to get into virtual reality.” Immersive technology helps people better visualize complex information, such as subsurface details. BaselineZ started in 2017 to enable geologists to collaborate on subsurface data in a VR environment. “Our biggest concept was that geologist A could collaborate with geologist B anywhere in the world,” Jim Thom, business development advisor for BaselineZ, told JPT. And while the platform, which allows users to interact with data and 3D models in an immersive environment, remotely and at scale, has been used to help geoscientists better understand subsurface data, BaselineZ has expanded its use cases. Beyond core analysis, the other main uses are education and storytelling, he said. An immersive environment can help “a new engineer, a new geologist, a new geophysicist, a new manager to a very complex asset” get up to speed much more quickly with a better depth of knowledge as compared to learning through slide decks, Thom said. 3D storytelling can be used to educate the public on complex projects, such as carbon capture. “Imagine the public is sitting there thinking, ‘Well, I want carbon out of the environment, but I don’t want it underneath my ranch.’ So how do you explain to them that it’s okay?” Thom asked. 3D storytelling using immersive technology can give people a much deeper understanding of the project, he said. BaselineZ was originally designed for a VR environment, with users accessing the immersive environment by wearing VR headsets. But, as Gerard de Jager, director of strategy at BaselineZ, told JPT, “It turns out that a lot of people were not ready for that.” But people are ready for a modernized version of the costly visualization rooms of the past. One of the drawbacks of past viz rooms was the cost. Not only were they pricey, sometimes running to millions of dollars and taking months to build out, but the rooms could only display content prepared ahead of time and typically required someone to operate them. Perhaps one of the biggest problems with viz rooms of the past is they were not conducive to collaboration, Thom said, recalling one conversation with an oil company professional. “One of the managers said, ‘Why is it that we call these collaboration rooms when it’s more like a movie theater? How would you expect us to collaborate with these stupid (3D) glasses on in a dark room?’” he said. In short, he explained, the design and parameters of viz rooms of the past were self-defeating. Essentially, they missed the mark. “I called it a near miss because the industry wanted to have this,” Thom said. Such rooms would allow companies to derive more value from high-salaried experts, and they would help promote safety, he said. “They wanted to solve all that. They invested a lot of money. There was a lot of money, time, and effort, and I call it a near miss.” Over time, technology has evolved, and prices have dropped on many of the elements needed to create viz rooms. Igloo Vision Ltd.’s Holly Mindel, business development manager, told JPT that viz rooms of the past were so costly partly because the previously available blending and warping software used in creating the immersive experience was military grade, expensive, and inaccessible to most businesses. Beyond that, many of the immersive rooms could only handle limited types of content and required multiple media servers to run. Finally, she said, the rooms typically required someone with experience to run them. Igloo Vision, a shared immersive space company known for its immersive geodesic-shaped domes as well as cubes and cylinders, wanted to create a flexible immersive system that could be used for multiple use cases. Beyond the oil industry, Igloo customizes rooms for architecture, big tech, education, and sports. It is able to accommodate any type of content, she said. Over time, technology has improved and much of the equipment needed has dropped in price, to the point where a smaller custom Igloo immersion room, which projects imagery onto the room’s four walls and its floor, can be built out for about $250,000 in less than a week following a consultative process that helps define and establish content development workflows. And, Mindel said, the rooms don’t require a dedicated operator. This month, Igloo is opening an immersive demo room in Houston. Kitted out with 4K projectors, the room shows off the capabilities of a modern immersive room to oil and gas clients considering setting up such a facility on their own premises. Since 2014, the company has installed a number of rooms powered by between four and 12 projectors for oil and gas clients around the world. The rooms are powered by the hardware-agnostic Igloo Core Engine, which supports use of VR, 3D, and 360-degree content, as well as web-based content, presentation and office tools, and game-engine-based content from Unity and Unreal Engine. A feature called true perspective automatically applies true-to-life perspective to 3D models. The whole room can be controlled by technical or nontechnical people using phones, laptops, game controllers, and/or tablets, and it requires a single server to run. It integrates with a number of third-party apps, including the BaselineZ digital twin and model‑viewing platform. De Jager said BaselineZ has worked with the Igloo team to standardize the application as a plug-and-play solution for use in viz rooms. “For a core team, or for a drilling team, we have a standardized solution.” Whether experts are gathering virtually from around the world using VR headsets or in an immersive room, the software makes it possible to bring knowledge together without the need for travel, he said. Thom called it gathering the collective genius. “When we drill wells in the energy business, there is a clear separation between the geology, geophysics, exploration department, and the drilling engineering department. And why is that? Because they can’t see everything together,” he said. “The drilling engineers will look at the problem in a way that says, ‘How far can I bend a pipe if I’m doing a long-reach well in deepwater?’ And the geologists will be sitting there thinking, ‘Why can’t you hit this target that’s 26,000 ft below here?’ But (the drilling engineer has) to drill through the fault in a certain way so that the well doesn’t get stuck.” Putting the different disciplines—who may otherwise have a difficult time communicating with one another—together in an immersive room enables them to collaborate more easily because they can see all their data at the same time, he said. “Not only can they see the geomodel but imagine now also that the engineer can have their drilling torque sitting right here” and can see what might happen if a variable is changed, he said. Such rooms can also be used to better understand challenges that need to be solved. De Jager said people from multiple locations were working to solve a drilling problem in India, where the very large Igloo room allowed them to see the issue at scale. “It’s not a flat screen, but it’s also at the scale of the drilling problem,” he said, adding he found it “a fascinating learning that looking at the problems in scale is helping to find the right answers.” In the oil and gas industry, people train to prevent and avoid problems. John Morgan, senior principal for energy systems at DNV, told JPT industry professionals can come to DNV’s Spadeadam Research and Testing facility in the UK to “see a real, live, full-scale fire or explosion, the sort of thing that they spend a lot of their jobs trying to avoid and prevent. Clearly, not things that you actually want to see in an oil and gas situation. But the danger is, if you’ve never seen these things, you never realize how bad a 30-ft fire is, or an explosion.” But travel can be expensive and time-consuming, so alternatives like VR training can be attractive. “If you go to Spadeadam and see a 20-ft jet fire, it’s loud, it’s hot, all those things. You don’t forget it. If you see me standing up giving a presentation, well, maybe you might remember it for a little bit, but it’s probably not one of your highlights of the year. VR is sort of halfway between the two. It’s something that people are not using on a day-to-day basis, so they do remember it, and that means they remember the major hazard safety message that comes with it,” Morgan said. VR training scenarios can reflect realistic tasks that might go wrong on an oil and gas site, and DNV has developed a series of immersive VR for major accident-avoidance training, which are licensed to oil and gas companies. “The VR doesn’t quite look like offshore, but it definitely doesn’t look like a CAD model with shiny red bits and bits of green structure or whatever else that you’ve got. It looks more like an offshore environment, really making you think you are offshore,” Morgan said. The point, though, is realistic training for hazard avoidance, he said. In one of DNV’s scenarios, a piece of scaffolding drops and impacts on a small-bore connection, which fails and releases high-pressure gas which then ignites and causes a fire. “We have people with a bit of vertigo who don’t like that scenario at all because it’s realistic. It literally feels like you’re on the edge of a big process plant, looking 20, 30-ft over the edge,” Morgan said. “It allows people to really think they are on that site, which is why it’s so memorable, which is why it really drills home the message for them.” The scenarios also include a running timer so users must react to situations on the same timescale as in real life. “There’s no point in doing VR if you can take a pause and give it your best answer,” he said. “You have 10 seconds to make a choice.” He said offshore safety representatives have given “great feedback” on the scenarios, particularly regarding trainee engagement. “You’ll go through a whole career and never see anything remotely like a major hazard,” Morgan said, which means “complacency can set in.” Engaging the workforce during training is essential. One of DNV’s VR training customers is Harbour Energy, and the pair delivered a case history paper on the topic in SPE 215563, presented at 2023 Offshore Europe. In the paper, the coauthors concluded that the use of VR for accident-avoidance awareness training enhances workforce engagement at all levels of the organization. “It is clear that there remains untapped potential in the use of the VR technology for the purpose of promoting process safety, which should be further evaluated,” they wrote. Under DNV’s commercial model for immersive training, they reinvest one-third of the licensing fees back into the VR training program to develop fresh and more-complex scenarios. Tayfun Babadagli, a petroleum engineering professor at the University of Alberta, said his research group is using VR headsets in its research into how proppant transports in fractures, among other things. He said the idea is to visualize the model and processes three-dimensionally, studying the processes from different angles as the visual model is moved around. He said the computational models are helping to better understand the physics and mechanics of how proppants move in pore space or in fractures than when merely using 2D visualization or graphical output. VR makes it possible to visualize what’s happening between the wall of the fracture and proppant and how the proppant transports in the reservoir environment, he said. “Even the interaction between the two proppants—they hit each other, they collide,” Babadagli told JPT. “This is why VR is helpful.” The system his research group is using is a simple one that serves their purpose, he said. It includes a large TV screen with 3D visualization capacity, cameras, headsets, a pair of workstations with video cards and software, and a joystick control system. “3D is the main thing,” he added.

Guest Editorial: Out of the West: Geothermal Opportunities Expand Beyond Historical Boundaries,https://jpt.spe.org/guest-editorial-out-of-the-west-geothermal-opportunities-expand-beyond-historical-boundaries,"Until relatively recently, harnessing geothermal energy in the US to meet power production and heating needs has been largely restricted to the western states. The first geothermal production wells in this country were drilled in The Geysers, California, and much of the development since that time has similarly taken place in the west. As of 2021, the states of California and Nevada (combined) accounted for 85% of the country’s geothermal power plants and 93% of the installed capacity, with no geothermal plants being located any further east than New Mexico. The reason for this is that exploiting geothermal energy in the conventional manner requires a very specific setting. Heat, fluid, and rock permeability must all be in abundance to utilize the Earth’s thermal energy. The western states’ geologic setting to the Pacific Ring of Fire results in several such locations. However, advances in technology are opening opportunities in other parts of the country as well. Technological developments impacting geothermal include enhanced/engineered geothermal systems (EGS), closed-loop or advanced geothermal systems (AGS), and thermal energy networks (TENs). Enhanced Geothermal Systems EGS aren’t a new concept. The belief that areas with sufficient heat and moisture but lacking appropriate permeability could be engineered into viable geothermal reservoirs has been discussed for years, but recent developments are making this a reality. In 2023, Fervo Energy announced a milestone in EGS development when a 30-day well test at their Project Red commercial pilot site demonstrated a flow rate of 63 L/sec at high temperature that enables 3.5 MW of electric production, setting records for both flow and output from an EGS. The well test circulated fluid through the doublet system by pumping fluid down an injection well, through a fractured reservoir system, and up a production well. The injection pump located on the well pad provided all the pressure to drive fluid through the system with no need for a downhole pump or artificial lift system. Sage Geosystems Inc. recently announced that it will partner with San Miguel Electric Cooperative Inc. to build the first geopressured geothermal system. The 3-MW EarthStore system will utilize the Earth's natural capacity for energy storage to produce dispatchable electricity on demand. Sage will operate as a merchant, buying electricity when production is plentiful, then storing it and selling back to the grid during periods of shortage. The facility, located in Christine, Texas, will use Sage’s proprietary technology to store energy, with a target storage duration of from 6 to 10 hours. Utah's Frontier Observatory for Research in Geothermal Energy (FORGE) is an international field laboratory dedicated to developing and testing the methods and techniques required to create, sustain, and monitor enhanced geothermal systems resources. It is managed by the Energy & Geoscience Institute at The University of Utah and funded by the US Department of Energy. The project recently achieved a major breakthrough for the industry when circulation tests proved fluid flow and energy transfer from an EGS reservoir in hot, dry granite. Advanced Geothermal Systems AGS are closed-loop systems that don’t require a constant source of water. These systems circulate a manmade fluid through a sealed piping system to absorb through conduction and transport the heated fluid to the surface. After driving a turbine to produce power, the cooled liquid is cycled through the closed-loop piping system to be reheated. There is no direct interaction between the subsurface environment and the liquid in the pipes. One company helping advance this approach is Canadian-based Eavor, whose Eavor-Loop technology utilizes a closed system that circulates a proprietary working fluid, thus limiting the need for accessibly fluids and rock permeability in the site. In 2023, the company celebrated the inauguration of their first commercial project in Geretsried, Germany, which targets 8.2 MW of power by 2026. AGS are also being used to extend the lifespan and increase the production in existing geothermal wells. GreenFire Energy recently announced a project to demonstrate their GreenLoop system at The Geysers geothermal field in northern California. The Geysers was the first geothermal field in the US used to produce electricity and is among the largest developed geothermal fields in the world, but it has experienced a decline in production over the years. GreenFire’s closed-loop system uses a downhole tube-in-tube heat exchanger to circulate a variety of working fluids, creating a system that extracts heat rather than water, thereby preserving the resource. Thermal Energy Networks While not as geologically limited as conventional geothermal power production, geothermal district heating systems have also traditionally been focused in the western states, beginning well over a century ago in Boise, Idaho. TENs are utility-scale thermal energy infrastructure projects that connect multiple buildings into a shared network involving thermal energy sources such as geothermal boreholes, surface water, and wastewater. They operate at lower temperature differentials compared to traditional district heating systems, giving them a variety of advantages, including lower heat losses, flexible heat sources, energy storage compatibility, and reduced infrastructure costs. At least 13 states are currently implementing TENs, including East Coast states such as New York, New Jersey, and Massachusetts. Most of these projects are still in the planning or regulatory stage, but construction has already begun in a few places. The first geothermal network pilot project in the US began construction in 2022. Located in Framingham, Massachusetts, the route consists of 36 buildings (24 residential and five commercial) and a total of 125 customer accounts. Expanding Geothermal Market The geographic expansion of possible geothermal project locations opens up the possibility of dramatically increased investment in the industry. A 2024 Wood Mackenzie article estimates that though global spending on geothermal pilot projects is currently limited to a few hundred million USD, it could rise to as much as $1 trillion by 2050 if these next-generation technologies succeed in making geothermal development location-agnostic. This increased investment is, to some degree, already being seen. At least six startups have closed significant funding rounds this year. The focus of these companies varies—from developing new drilling methods to improving well designs to using artificial intelligence (AI) to reduce exploration costs. But the complementary nature of these goals makes the sector as a whole more attractive to potential investors. In addition to the exploration and development companies, there are also a variety of service, technology, and equipment design companies among the recent geothermal startups. Some of the services offered include reservoir stimulation, HVAC system installation, and advanced AI sensing techniques. Tool and equipment companies have focused on aspects such as improved drilling technology, subsurface monitoring tools, and software development. Texas seems to be a nexus of geothermal startups. According to a 2023 report, titled “The Future of Geothermal in Texas: The Coming Century of Growth & Prosperity in the Lone Star State,” from 2016 to 2022, 11 of the 27 geothermal-related startups in the US were headquartered in Texas. Of the 43 total startups polled for the report, 39% were engaged with AGS technology, 23% were engaged with EGS, and 15% were pursuing either both or hybrid concepts. Only 23% were not involved with either technology. The same poll showed 31% of the startups focused on power production, 23% pursuing direct-use heat applications, and another 23% engaged with both. Moving Forward (and Eastward) For the bulk of its history, the geothermal industry in the US has been constrained by its geographic limitations. But new technologies are breaking down these limitations and seem to be creating the right set of circumstances for expansion into the rest of the country, and indeed, the world. Overcoming the geographic requirements of geothermal production could be game-changing for the industry, as well as the energy sector as a whole. TENs are already bringing geothermal heating and cooling to the Midwest and East Coast, while EGS and AGS technologies point toward the possibility of geothermal power production anywhere. As states wrestle with how to meet their Renewable Portfolio Standards, geothermal offers the highest capacity factor among renewable sources, as well as a competitive Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE). It also offers a small surface land footprint, near-zero emissions, and the flexibility to ramp up or down to help cover changing operational requirements through the day as the output of intermittent renewables varies. Geothermal power, heating, and cooling coming soon—to a state near you.

Global Deepwater Rig Demand Seen Flat in 2025,https://jpt.spe.org/global-deepwater-rig-demand-seen-flat-in-2025-restricted,"The deepwater rig market has benefited from a bullish outlook over the past several months as many available rigs have been contracted, stacked rigs reactivated, and working rigs rolled to new, more lucrative contracts, including some fetching more than $500,000/day. Today, however, some gray clouds loom on the horizon. New inquiries and contracts for floating rigs have slowed, driven by several factors including some regional softness in the Far East market, oil price visibility, projects competing for limited funds, and lingering questions about what the changing of the guard in Washington, DC, will truly mean for the oil and gas business in general. These are just some of the issues that have resulted in project deferrals for some operators. The good news is that many of the top offshore contractors have solid backlogs that will keep them busy during the trough, which is expected to last at least through the first 6 months of the year. Transocean booked nearly $1.3 billion in backlog in the third quarter of 2024 alone. The recent awards will keep the company’s active fleet more than 97% utilized for 2025. Noble Drilling, fresh from closing its acquisition of rival Diamond Offshore, said though its fleet will experience suboptimal utilization in the near term, a high level of tangible contract opportunities is expected to drive a backlog inflection sometime next year. Seadrill boss Simon Johnson told investors recently that despite the near-term imbalance between available rigs and opportunities, the company remains resolute in its belief in the strength and durability of the offshore drilling industry and the contractor’s position within it. Valaris President and Chief Executive Anton Dibowitz summed up it up this way to investors in November: “While we have seen some customer demand deferred, the outlook for 2026 and beyond remains robust.

"What You Need To Know About Automation vs. Autonomy, and the Future of Drilling Tech",https://jpt.spe.org/what-you-need-to-know-about-automation-vs-autonomy-and-the-future-of-drilling-tech-restricted,"As the oil and gas industry becomes more familiar with advanced drilling technologies, it also runs the risk of becoming too loose with its language. This word of caution comes from John de Wardt, a recognized leader in drilling systems automation and founder of the consultancy De Wardt and Company, who recently published SPE 217754 with a team of other subject-matter experts from across the industry. In particular, the group of industry colleagues sought to address the overextension of the term autonomous as opposed to automation in reference to various drilling systems and tools. Presented at last year’s SPE/IADC International Drilling Conference, their paper introduces a new taxonomy for autonomous drilling systems, offering a guide to distinguish between automation and true autonomy. It also highlights other critical concepts, including multi-agent artificial intelligence (AI) and the importance of a “system of systems” approach. In this Q&A, de Wardt explores the paper’s goals while offering a candid look at where advanced drilling technologies stand today and where they’re headed next. JPT: What motivated the paper’s authors to develop a new taxonomy for autonomous drilling systems, what gaps were you aiming to address? John de Wardt: I initiated this by presenting at a Drilling Systems Automation Technical Section (DSATS) monthly meeting about the industry’s use of the word autonomous. I had seen many articles and company publications claiming to describe autonomous systems, but what they were describing were not, in fact, autonomous. I thought the term was being misused. The presentation received a positive response, which led to the formation of this group and, ultimately, the development of the paper.

Case Study: Advanced Solutions for Complex Drilling Challenges,https://jpt.spe.org/case-study-advanced-solutions-for-complex-drilling-challenges,"While renewable energy development continues to rise, the transition from traditional hydrocarbons is not progressing as rapidly as once expected, and oil and gas is still set to be a key player in the energy mix by mid-century. There has been significant development of green technologies and increased investments in wind, solar, and hydrogen energy, but the demand for hydrocarbons continues to grow, driven by global energy demand and the complexities of transitioning entire energy infrastructures. As the world aims to balance energy security with sustainability and affordability, it is clear hydrocarbons will continue to fulfil a critical role in meeting energy demand for the foreseeable future. It will take the next 27 years to move the energy mix from the present 80% fossil/20% non‑fossil split to 48%/52% (DNV Energy Transition Outlook, 2023). Looming net-zero goals have placed operators under the microscope as they grapple with the challenge of maintaining profitability while adhering to environmental regulations. There are also increasing expectations from stakeholders and investors who are factoring environmental, social, and governance criteria into their investment decisions. Operators must now demonstrate not just financial viability, but also a commitment to sustainable practices. The drilling landscape in particular faces more complex challenges than ever before as it contends with fluctuating oil prices, more stringent environmental regulations, and increasingly complicated wells. While advances in exploration and drilling technologies have transformed the industry, unlocking previously inaccessible reserves and increasing production rates, the risk and technical difficulties associated with drilling operations have also escalated. As the sector strives to reduce its carbon footprint, advancements in drilling technologies are not only helping to minimize environmental impact, but also enabling more-efficient operations in increasingly complex well conditions. Stuck-pipe incidents are a frequent challenge during drilling operations, often costing operators millions in remediation. The remediation process is complex, frequently requiring days or even weeks of nonproductive time (NPT) and resources that may not be immediately available. Such incidents can arise from various factors, including differential sticking which occurs when pressure differences between the mud column and formation fluids cause the drillstring to stick against the wellbore wall, creating a ""stuck spot"" that immobilizes the pipe. Packoff is also a common issue where accumulated cuttings, debris, or other materials around the drillstring create a blockage. In any situation, even if partial movement is possible, circulation and rotation are often not feasible. As each stuck-pipe scenario is unique, resolving it often necessitates a customized approach. Operators frequently find themselves constrained by a lack of available solutions, limiting their ability to respond effectively to a stuck‑pipe situation. Jarring is a traditional stuck-pipe recovery method that uses mechanical or hydraulic tools to deliver sudden, high-impact forces to the drillstring to free the stuck pipe. Though this method can be effective, it is expensive and can take days or longer, which results in significant NPT to the project. If the stuck pipe cannot be resolved, the last resort is to perform a disconnect, traditionally requiring mobilization of a wireline crew to deploy an explosive charge, known as a backoff or string shot. The explosives must be detonated above the freepoint to sever the string and can leave an unpredictable fishing profile for future operation. This technique can be time-consuming, costly, and introduces a new set of risks into the operation by deploying third-party crews and transporting hazardous materials to the rigsite. During a recent project offshore Azerbaijan, an operator’s drilling assembly became stuck when drilling an 8½×10¼-in. section of a well. Despite extensive jarring attempts, the operator was unable to move the string or circulate mud in the well. This meant that operations to sever the assembly to regain circulation were required. Coretrax, an Expro company and global leader in oil and gas well integrity and production optimization, delivered its downhole circulation technology to remediate the issue. The company’s DAV MX and HyPR Holesaver had been deployed in the string as part of the customer’s wider risk assessment in case of a stuck-pipe incident. The solutions remain dormant in the string while still providing a contingency option if needed, providing an immediate remediation solution. The tools were selected as the narrow inner diameter of the drillstring components meant that traditional wireline-deployed tools were not suitable. Ahead of deploying the tools, Coretrax provided standard operating procedure documents, which were tailored for the specific rig and well conditions, meaning no additional personnel were required on site to run the tools. This enabled the operator to start corrective operations immediately when the stuck pipe occurred. Following considerable jarring activities, the operator achieved 50 gal/min of flow in the well. While this is a fraction of the circulation usually achieved, it was sufficient to enable activation of a 7-in. DAV MX circulation sub. Once activated, the sub allowed the operator to regain full circulation above the stuck point. The versatile technology is largely immune to variations in angle, temperature, differential pressure, mud type, and mud weight and has a number of activation darts to support applications across drilling, completions, or plugging and abandonment. In this case, the tool was deployed with an emergency opening ball (EOB). The EOB is used specifically for restricted circulation applications where it is not possible to pump or deploy darts to the DAV MX. The ball can be deployed in complete packoff or plugged‑string scenarios as long as the inclination of the well allows for it. The EOB was selected because the well angled at 68° which would allow the ball to gravitate down to the setting. After 2 hours, the ball successfully reached the circulating sub and full circulation was restored. The operator then deployed the 2.405-in.-outer-diameter HyPR Holesaver with the fishing dart to sever the string. Unlike conventional methods, this tool requires no explosives or other high-energy sources to deliver significant safety and efficiency benefits. When activated, the flow of ordinary mud is redirected, creating a high-velocity radial jet of fluid to erode and cut pipe in just a few hours. The fishing dart leaves clear and unrestricted access to the fish after it has cut the string free, enabling fishing of the bottomhole assembly (BHA) to commence almost immediately following cutting. Interference added to its tail also means that as the cut pipe is withdrawn it collects the fishing dart and carries it back to surface. After 30 minutes, the dart reached the HyPR sub and commenced with the hydraulic cut which was completed after approximately 10 hours of operation, and torque and overpull were applied to the string. Utilizing the technology, the team was able to successfully sever the stuck pipe, and the BHA above the severance point was successfully recovered to surface. When compared to traditional wireline methods, the application of this technology saved an estimated 2 days of rig time which is generally required for techniques involving explosives while also eliminating the need for additional specialist personnel on board. As the energy transition continues to evolve, the oil and gas industry faces an intricate balancing act: meeting global energy demands while adhering to increasingly stringent environmental regulations. This challenge is particularly evident in the drilling sector, where the complexities and risks are higher, and the margin for error smaller. Innovative technology is essential in overcoming these hurdles to enable operators to address the most-challenging drilling situations safer, faster, and more efficiently. The application of Coretrax’s circulation technology demonstrates the opportunities which can be garnered from having advanced contingency tools integrated into drilling operations. By allowing the operator to regain circulation and successfully sever the stuck pipe without the need for explosives or additional third-party crews, these technologies delivered significant time and cost savings while mitigating operational risks. By embracing technological advancements, operators can not only optimize their current practices but also contribute to the broader goals of reducing the carbon footprint and supporting a sustainable energy future.

A Cold Look at the Quality of SPE Publications,https://jpt.spe.org/a-cold-look-at-the-quality-of-spe-publications,"Editor’s Note: This is a summary of the January episode of the President’s vodcast. We encourage you to watch the episode to see the full conversation. Publication quality was one of the 2025 topics I discussed in my September 2024 JPT column. While I believe we can be proud of the best of our publications, generally strengthened by rigorous peer review, I also believe we have a serious problem with the quality of, let’s say, our lowest quartile, and maybe more. Until recently, we could live with this, i.e., use the best and ignore the rest. But now we are applying generative AI to all our content to fine-tune energy large language models (ELLM). What are the impacts of a “heterogeneous” publication quality (if such heterogeneity is confirmed) on the resulting ELLM? Originally, I wanted to dedicate a single column to the issue of publication quality. But as I was researching, I realized this topic deserves two columns—one to present the issues and another on the possible paths to address these issues. The time interval between these columns will be used to consult groups and individuals who know the SPE publication aspects better than I do, and who would likely be part of any solution. I know it is subjective, but we have all heard comments like the one below from an “interlocutor” (albeit a friend of mine who feels comfortable enough to be brutally blunt). “The quality of SPE papers is going down the drain. There is no bottom. I have given up on going to technical sessions as well. Nothing is comparable to the situation when I joined the industry. There are too many events and publications. And worst of all, however bad a paper is, it will find an event to be accepted and make it to OnePetro. We have lost our way.” I confess that such comments generally come from senior members. Sometimes, I catch myself thinking along these lines, although I should know better. This can be heard at the SPE Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition (ATCE), our flagship technical event once the holy grail for any member to publish his or her work. Even SPE’s peer-reviewed papers do not escape the wrath of our most critical members. When digging a bit, my interlocutor acknowledges that there are still good works published by SPE, sufficient to make our industry move forward. However, these papers are (and I quote) “drowning in an ocean of mediocracy!” So, are we that bad, or is this just the complaint of grumpy old members missing their glory days? After all, our younger members, who have no such reference points, seem to be reasonably happy with what we deliver. As for my discussion on governance last month, any discussion on publication quality is, up to a point, a subjective topic, and it is not about looking at individual papers and pointing fingers at their authors. After all, if we set the bar too low, we cannot criticize our members for not jumping high enough. We can only acknowledge a common perception of declining publication quality. To confirm or challenge this perception, we must have metrics. Let us look at the “exact” numbers of our publications and factor in the evolving size of our membership. I put “exact” in quotes because the oldest papers are over 100 years old, and we may have lost some collective memory. For example, all papers published between 1920 and 1950 are listed as peer reviewed. There may have been a systematic peer-review process at the time, or maybe non-reviewed papers just went into oblivion. Relevant information in our publications has only been reliable for the past 60 years. Any member who followed the evolution knows there has been an inflation in the number of events and publications. You only need to check recent SPE communications to know this. My MS thesis was presented in 1984 at the SPE California Regional Meeting as SPE Paper 12778 and later published in September 1988 in the SPE Formation Evaluation Journal. The highest index for an SPE paper is almost 225,000, while we don’t have more than 200,000 SPE papers in the archive, we do have more than 100,000 SPE/AIME papers in the OnePetro archive. To begin, let’s look at our yearly publication of papers that reach OnePetro. Fig. 1a shows this evolution on a year-on-year basis, whereas Fig. 1b shows a near-perfect exponential trend in publications year-on-year (which is a consistent observation in publication counts across scientific and technical literature). Fig. 1c provides running 5-year averages, which may help to visualize the ever-increasing trend. Today, most papers reaching OnePetro have gone through a selection process by the technical program committee for a given event, where the process begins with an abstract based on which the selection takes place. Then some events have a “submission review” by the session chairs and/or selected committee members. The paper is then delivered to SPE and is processed by staff to detect commercialism and plagiarism. Finally, the paper is presented at the event. There is a “last chance” after the event to submit a revised version of the paper before consideration in the peer-review process (if the author elects peer review). Another important statistic is the number of peer-reviewed papers. After submitting and presenting an SPE conference paper, the author(s) must decide whether to submit their paper for peer review. This is a relatively recent development as historically all SPE conference papers underwent peer review, but the volume became untenable. Once submitted for peer review, the “clock starts,” and a review is provided to the author in 60 days or less. If the paper completes peer review, it then goes on to publication (e.g., the SPE Journal). Note: Obviously, there is a phase during peer review where the author(s) address questions/requirements from the reviewers and editors, and there is an appeals process for papers initially declined. The statistics on peer-reviewed papers are shown in Fig. 2a with 5-year averages in Fig. 2b. We can see a recent surge of peer reviews, which may be linked to the recovery from the pandemic or is simply related to the industry’s recovery (analogous to the 2005–2015 period). As the name implies, peer-reviewed “journal articles” are published in journals. Fig. 2c shows the evolution of the SPE journal publications over time. Historically, we had only the Journal of Petroleum Technology (JPT) and the SPE Journal. Whereas after 1986, we had several SPE discipline-specific journals as well (one can see the lists of names). In terms of volume, there have been 18,000 peer-reviewed papers between 1920 and 2024; in terms of interpretation, there is no easy way (nor real interest) to de-correlate or decouple increasing content in SPE journals. Also, as of 2024, we are back to only having two journals—JPT for technical articles and synopses of OnePetro papers and the SPE Journal for specific interest and research articles. Let’s now consider the ratio of peer-reviewed “journal articles” to peer-evaluated “conference papers,” as shown in Fig. 3a as the percentage of peer-reviewed papers, with 5-year averages shown in Fig. 3b. These graphs present a truly remarkable illustration of the evolution of SPE over the past century, including when SPE was just a committee of the American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical, and Petroleum Engineers (AIME). There are many interpretations of the data in Figs. 3a and 3b, perhaps the most important of which is that in the past 25 years, the ratio of journal articles to conference papers is less than 10% (at least until very recently). This low percentage should imply that peer review is working and that journal papers are of a much higher status (hence, quality) as compared to conference papers. However, is this really the case? An equiprobable interpretation could also be that with the proliferation of conference papers, the journal papers will reflect the same “dilution” in quality reflected in conference papers. First and foremost, these are just “counts” (numbers) at present. In terms of the “decline” in the journal-to-conference paper trend beginning around 1950, we believe that this is due to SPE’s focus on a much wider array of events. When I started in 1982, the general understanding was that around half of the SPE papers would be peer reviewed. The exact figure turns out to be more like 35% (or about 1 in 3). When I presented my first paper in 1984, it was my MS thesis, coauthored by Roland Horne and Hank Ramey. It was peer reviewed and ended up in an edition of the SPE Formation Evaluation Journal (4 years later). This was a good day for the young professional that I was. I wish this were that “easy” for a YP today. The last statistics I will present (again) are related to the evolution of SPE professional membership (Fig. 4a), with 5-year averages shown in Fig. 4b. They will be used as a normalization factor of the statistics above. We have gone back in time as far as we could, and honestly, we cannot (and should not) draw too many conclusions from what we think happened 100 or more years ago. We will now focus on the past 45 years and take the 1975–1979 period as a reference, which is the time when those who have recently retired likely joined the industry. During this time, the ratio of peer-reviewed papers to conference papers was approximately 40%. In Fig. 5a, we see the evolution of the number of both peer-reviewed papers and OnePetro papers at large, and we note that there is nothing “obvious” in Fig. 5a, other than the “COVID rollover” (2020–2024) in OnePetro papers and a relatively significant increase in journal articles. However, in Fig. 5b we normalize both curves with the corresponding numbers for the reference period 1975–1979. The number of OnePetro papers at large was multiplied by 11 before the pandemic and is now back to 10 times post-COVID. Conversely, the number of peer-reviewed papers was multiplied by 2 before the pandemic and went up to a factor of 3 post-COVID. However, these numbers do not consider the evolution of SPE membership over the same period. In Fig. 6a, we present the number of SPE papers yearly published per 1,000 members, as the increase in membership could justify a proportional increase in publications without necessarily bringing a reduction in quality. In Fig. 6b, we present the evolution of the number of peer-reviewed papers compared to all OnePetro papers, normalized by the evolution of membership over 1975–1979. Two clear observations: 1. In 45 years, the number of OnePetro papers, normalized with the number of SPE members, was multiplied by nearly a factor of 4. If we consider that our membership is not significantly less nor significantly more talented than in the 1980s, the publications we produced in the 1980s would correspond to the highest quartile of today’s publications. This also means, unfortunately, that 75% of today’s publications are below, if not well below our 1980s standards for publication. There is a limitation with these sorts of comparisons, but statistics do not lie at this scale. 2. In the past 45 years, the number of peer-reviewed papers, normalized by the number of members has been relatively stable, give or take a recent post-pandemic surge. We may consider that the peer-review process has not significantly changed, but it would point to a stable quality of these papers, with the caveat that selecting candidate papers may be more complicated considering the much higher volume of OnePetro papers. The massive increase in the number of SPE papers can be correlated to the inflation of events and technical sessions we have seen in the past decades. These events are also member benefits that have significantly benefited SPE and originated from regional demand from our stakeholders. Fig. 7 shows the number of events with technical sessions (i.e., where SPE papers are presented). It does not include events such as workshops, forums, and summits, where no paper is presented. The number of events with papers has tripled since 1980, from around 10 to around 30 per year. This inflation in the number of events also came with an inflation in the number of conference papers per event, as shown in Fig. 8. This can be attributed partly to the growth in the size of the individual events. Still, the number of papers per event has more than tripled during the same period, a number consistent with the global 10-fold increase in the number of published papers. This increase is, however, not uniform. Fig. 9 shows the evolution of the number of papers published at ATCE and OTC, which is consistent with the increase in our membership, and the spectacular evolution of the number of papers published at ADIPEC since it became a yearly event in 2014. Beyond perception, statistics confirm a 10-fold increase in the number of SPE papers published yearly since 1980. The ratio is reduced to 4 if we account for the evolution of the size of our membership. One direct interpretation is that only the top 25% of today’s papers have the average quality of what we published 45 years ago. The rest are below. It is my opinion but there is no smoking gun, as there may be other interpretations. First objection: This increased ratio does not mechanically result in lower publication quality—at least not by a factor of 4. Modern technology has considerably accelerated our ability to accomplish more research and to create and consume more data successively, which could lead to more publishable material. Simultaneously, modern editing tools significantly improve and expand the writing process, increasing our ability to produce more quality material. Second objection: This inflation in the number of publications is not unique to SPE and our industry. There is a general trend, and we are not an outlier. There is a concern about the quality of research and publications at large. In a way, it is reassuring to see that we are not the only ones with quality problems in our publications, though it is not an excuse for doing nothing about it. And there are (of course) objections to these objections. I will stop here and open the debate: For those who agree that there is a serious problem with SPE publication quality, the question is what should be done about it. This will be the topic of the second column on this topic, but without getting into the details, there are likely to be three main paths: 1. We do nothing (or not much). We accept this inflation of publications as something we cannot avoid, and as we do today, we use the best and ignore the rest. 2. We accept this flood of publications, but we find a systematic way to ‘promote’ higher-quality papers, creating an intermediate population between papers at large and peer-reviewed papers, which would statistically match the quality of 1980s papers, and for example could be good candidates for generative AI projects. 3. We do not give up at all. If we make a top‑down decision to divide the number of papers by 3 or 4, this just will not work. If we wish to reverse the trend in publication quality, this will be a major long-term undertaking that will involve many bottom-up actions at the committees’ level. SPE could provide a canvas or even a quality label. There are many possibilities, and we will explore these in a future column. You will note that I did not list any potential actions in this column, not because I have none, but because I have probably too many. I’d better do some reality (and acceptability) checks before sharing my ideas with you. You are welcome to contribute to the SPE Connect President’s page, on this topic and the ones covered in previous columns. I believe your contribution to the debate on quality may be significant.

"As China Shifts, ‘Business as Usual’ Feels Unusual",https://jpt.spe.org/as-china-shifts-business-as-usual-feels-unusual,"In September 2020, BP’s Energy Outlook presented a vision of a “rapid energy transition,” a scenario where global oil demand had already peaked due to the lasting effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The BP forecast held that sometime in our new year demand would fall to around 97 million B/D—some 3 million B/D short of pre-pandemic levels. Obviously, things turned out quite differently. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that by the end of 2024 global consumption reached 102.8 million B/D, surpassing BP’s projection by nearly 6 million B/D. Instead of a rapid transition, the world got a rapid recovery. However, BP’s 2020 report didn’t offer just one scenario. It also floated a “business as usual” case where demand stabilizes near 100 million B/D for the next 2 decades before gradually declining to 95 million B/D around 2050. Unlike the earlier prediction, recent indicators suggest that this one may be holding up a lot better. In November, the IEA estimated that global demand increased by only 920,000 B/D in 2024. That’s less than half of the 2.1 million B/D growth predicted at the start of the year and below the 10‑year pre-pandemic average of 1.5 million B/D. The sudden slowdown has been widely attributed to fading post-pandemic demand, softening global economic conditions, and the rise of alternative energy technologies. Nowhere is this pattern more evident and important to pay attention to right now than in China. After 3 years of strict travel restrictions, China reopened its economy in early 2023. Crude imports popped by 10% to 11.3 million B/D, signaling that China, already the world’s top importer, was returning to its role as the prime mover of global crude demand. This was conventional wisdom not long ago. But throughout last year we saw the IEA repeatedly revise its annual growth estimate for China, cutting it from 410,000 B/D to just 180,000 B/D. This compares with China’s average demand growth of over 600,000 B/D per year over the past decade. OPEC has clearly taken notice. Although not as bearish as the IEA, the organization announced in December that it now projects global demand to grow by just 1.61 million B/D in 2024, down from its July estimate of 2.25 million. China was not the sole reason for the downgrade, but it played a significant part: OPEC reduced its forecast for China’s annual growth from 760,000 B/D to 430,000 B/D. A slowing Chinese economy is certainly a key factor behind the downward projections, but it is only one part of the story here. Vitol Group, the world’s largest independent oil trader, reported in November that Chinese demand for gasoline and diesel have stalled out. “Future demand growth is almost entirely linked to petrochemical feedstocks—road fuels have already, or will soon peak,” Vitol concluded. The China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) went a step further in December when it issued a report predicting peak oil demand on an absolute basis in China will happen this year—5 years earlier than CNPC’s previous estimate of 2030. Such a development will be considered by many to be nothing short of a seismic shift in crude markets. For the past 20 years China has represented more than half of the world’s increase in consumption, amounting to about 16% of total global demand in 2023. This comes as Beijing spent years aggressively pushing for the adoption of liquefied natural gas to fuel its trucking fleets and electric vehicles (EVs) to move its people. The broad effort is seen as aligned not only with the country’s air pollution and carbon‑reduction goals but provides a new layer of supply security in an uncertain geopolitical environment. As a result of its policy and manufacturing prowess, the Asian nation of 1.4 billion is now the world’s leading manufacturer, buyer, and exporter of EVs. In fact, with the help of EV sales, China has in about 4 years’ time ascended to become the world’s top exporter of all vehicle types, surpassing long‑time leaders such as Japan, the US, Mexico, and Germany. China estimates that it now accounts for more than three-quarters of the global EV market after it sold more than 14 million units in the first 10 months of last year—about 30% of which were shipped abroad. Nevertheless, China’s EV revolution is moving at such a breakneck pace that it has raised questions as to whether it can be maintained. It has been pointed out that most Chinese EV manufacturers remain unprofitable and heavily reliant on government subsidies and incentives, some of which will expire in a few years. Elsewhere, existing tariffs have been recently hiked to build moats for domestic manufacturers with US buyers facing a 102.5% tariff on Chinese EVs and most European buyers a 45% tariff. These hurdles are designed to disrupt EV trade flows, but they are unlikely to hold back a shifting market. In the US, EV sales climbed from just 2% of light-duty vehicle sales in 2019 to 9% in 2024. When hybrids are included, electrified vehicles accounted for approximately 20% of sales last year in the US and on a global basis as well. For those in the upstream oil and gas sector, the outlook may be more pragmatic than pessimistic. The global energy mix is indeed changing, but not uniformly. If China’s consumption has peaked, India—already importing more than 4.6 million B/D—will take its place as the world’s biggest source of new demand. According to the IEA, India’s imports may hit 5.8 million B/D by 2030 as its refining and infrastructure grow. This seems to show us that if some producing nations hit a plateau, others could fill the gap and potentially keep global supplies near 100 million B/D for the foreseeable future. Yet forecasts are still being reassessed: BP, for instance, now expects 2050 demand to be around 75 million B/D, down from its 2020 forecast of 95 million B/D. No matter which scenario plays out, holding production at current levels, or managing a smooth decline, will require steady and significant investment in both fresh projects and legacy fields. Meanwhile, stepping beyond crude, the energy landscape is delivering positive surprises. Natural gas demand, once expected to grow steadily thanks to rising global power needs, is now set to be supercharged due to the proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) data centers. In the US, electricity consumption may jump more than 15% over the next 5 years—triple earlier estimates. EQT, ranked second among US natural gas producers, anticipates that meeting this need might call for nearly 18 Bcf/D of new supply by 2030, a prospect that may be echoed elsewhere as the AI boom spreads globally.

E&P Notes: January 2025,https://jpt.spe.org/e-p-notes-january-2025,"Equinor and its partners have discovered oil and gas in the North Sea’s wildcat wells 35/11-30 S and 35/11-30 A (“Rhombi”) with an estimated recoverable volume of 2.0–4.5 million Sm3 (12.6–28.3 million BOE). Located within production license 090, the wells may be tied to existing infrastructure, including the Troll C platform, which processes resources from the Fram licenses nearby. Drilled by the Deepsea Atlantic rig, the wells targeted the Upper and Middle Jurassic Sognefjord and Fensfjord formations. Well 35/11-30 S revealed 41 m of gas-filled sandstone and a 9-m aquiferous layer, while 35/11-30 A found a 43-m gas column and a 6-m oil column in the Sognefjord formation. In the Fensfjord formation, 35/11-30 S encountered a 72-m aquiferous layer, and 35/11‑30 A identified a 12-m oil column within a 100-m reservoir. Both wells were drilled to depths of approximately 2230–2260 m and were subsequently plugged and abandoned after comprehensive data collection. Equinor serves as operator and holds 45% interest with Vår Energi ASA (40%) and INPEX Idemitsu Norge AS (15%). ExxonMobil plans to drill two offshore natural gas wells near Cyprus, named Pegasus and Electra, in January 2025. This effort aligns with global moves to diversify energy sources following disruptions caused by the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. The East Mediterranean, known for recent gas discoveries, has become a strategic focus for energy companies. ExxonMobil, which secured exploration licenses in Cyprus in 2017, discovered significant gas reserves at Glaucus in 2019, estimated to contain 5–8 Tcf. Pegasus, near Glaucus in Block 10, shows hydrocarbon potential based on seismic data. Electra, located in Block 5, is considered a promising prospect with the potential for standalone development, pending appraisal drilling. “We’ve spent the last two years collecting very detailed, three-dimensional seismic data ... We’ve identified several large prospects, and the next stage is to bring in a drilling rig and to test those,” said John Ardill, ExxonMobil VP for global exploration. Empire Energy started drilling the Carpentaria-5H (C-5H) well in its 100%-owned EP187 permit in Australia’s Beetaloo Basin as part of the Carpentaria Pilot Project. The C-5H well aims to achieve Empire’s longest horizontal shale well, targeting a 3000-m drilled and cased horizontal section for increased gas production. Advanced techniques such as hydraulic stimulation with enhanced horsepower and slickwater design will be applied to boost productivity. Empire targets first gas flow in H1 2025 with a sales rate of up to 25 TJ/day, leveraging the McArthur River Pipeline. The project involves field development planning, regulatory approvals, pipeline access negotiations, gas marketing, and financing preparations. A $65-million financing package, including R&D funding, midstream infrastructure financing, and environmental bonding, supports drilling and infrastructure development. The Northern Territory Government has approved environmental plans for nine wells, a gas plant, and related facilities, though gas sales approval is still pending. The drilling of C-5H, led by Ensign Rig #965, is expected to reach a depth of more than 5000 m in 45 days. GeoPark Ltd., an independent energy company operating in Latin America, signed agreements to acquire Repsol’s upstream oil and gas assets in Colombia for approximately $530 million. The deal includes a 45% nonoperated interest in the CPO-9 Block and a 25% interest in SierraCol Energy Arauca LLC, located in Colombia’s Llanos and Arauca regions. The Llanos basin is one of the country’s most productive oil regions where GeoPark holds existing operations in the region. These assets produced around 16,000 BOED net to Repsol as of September 2024. The transfer of assets is expected to take place in Q1 2025. BP’s Q3 2024 report outlines significant progress in the Shah Deniz and Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli (ACG) fields in Azerbaijan’s Caspian Sea. At Shah Deniz 2, preparations are underway for the startup of a third gas production well on the East North flank. The Istiglal and Heydar Aliyev rigs have been actively drilling, performing decompletion and recompletion activities, and advancing well development on various flanks. So far, 21 wells have been drilled for Shah Deniz 2 across the field’s different sections. Additionally, BP is analyzing data from the SDX-8 exploration well to appraise deeper reservoirs beneath the currently producing layers. Production at the Azeri Central East (ACE) platform currently stands at 19,000 B/D, with plans to increase output to 24,000 B/D once a new well is drilled and brought online. This year, the ACG teams have completed 11 oil producers, two water injectors, and one cuttings-reinjection well. In September, SOCAR, BP, and other ACG partners signed an agreement to explore and develop the nonassociated gas (NAG) reservoirs, which could hold up to 4.0 Tcf of gas. An initial well is being drilled from the West Chirag platform to produce gas and provide data for future development planning. McDermott has received a front-end engineering design (FEED) contract from Repsol Exploración México for the Polok and Chinwol field development project in the Gulf of Mexico. McDermott will provide FEED services for the engineering, procurement, construction, and installation (EPCI) of subsea systems, including umbilicals, risers, and flowlines. The Polok and Chinwol fields, discovered by Repsol in 2020, are part of Mexico’s Block 29 in the Salina Basin. Block 29, located off the coast of southern part of Gulf of Mexico, is 88 km from the state of Tabasco and covers an area of 3254 km2. The project is still in the exploration phase. Repsol serves as operator and holds a 46.67% interest in the block with partners PC Carigali Mexico Operations (28.33%), Petronas’ Mexican subsidiary, and Harbour Energy (25%). China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) started production at the Jinzhou 23-2 oilfield development project in the Bohai Sea.

In Memoriam: Richard (Dick) Nelson,https://jpt.spe.org/memoriam-richard-dick-nelson,"Richard (Dick) Nelson, SPE, passed away 12 September 2024 in Ketchum, Idaho, at the age of 95. After receiving a PhD in chemistry from the University of Washington in 1954, he moved to California and started at Shell’s Martinez refinery. He also worked at Shell Development Company’s Emeryville Central Research Laboratory before moving to the company’s head office in Manhattan in late 1962. In 1965, he moved to the Union New Jersey refinery before being transferred back to Emeryville in 1968. He remained at Emeryville becoming manager of surfactant research until 1972 when the facility was slated for closure as part of Shell’s decision to centralize US corporate offices in Houston. Nelson’s transfer to exploration and production research was a fruitful transition. Utilizing the theoretical understanding of surfactant and oil chemistry he gained from his early career he published fundamental SPE papers that advanced the technology of chemical enhanced oil recovery (CEOR). Nelson focused on research that explained the importance of phase behavior and utilizing a salinity gradient in a chemical flood. Further research showed the importance of performing a final chemical formulation design with live crude oil (containing native solution gas) rather than relying on experimental results with dead (gas-free) stock‑tank oil. His greatest contribution was realizing that alkaline-enhanced oil recovery floods are fatally flawed due to the hydrophobic nature of the petroleum soaps that are formed, and the fact that alkali imparts significant salinity to injection brine. He realized that this situation can be corrected by including a small amount of hydrophilic co‑surfactant along with the alkali. He received a patent for this invention, and the discovery led to the commercial application of ASP (alkali-surfactant-polymer) flooding. ASP floods are currently being operated in Oman, Canada, Argentina, and India based on his invention. For these contributions he was awarded the Pioneer Award for Enhanced Oil Recovery in 2000.

EOR Modeling-2025,https://jpt.spe.org/eor-modeling-2025,"Most major global oil and gas companies have committed themselves to decarbonization strategies that reduce the carbon footprint and work toward the goals of climate-change mitigation. These commitments include the use of renewable energy sources, improvements in energy efficiency, and development of technologies that can capture and store carbon emissions. Even with such commitments, energy demand continues to rise globally, driven by population growth, industrialization, and economic progress. These are significant because they have a high energy density and an existing infrastructure. Enhanced oil recovery (EOR) techniques, particularly those involving CO2 injection (CO2‑EOR), can bridge the gap between current energy needs and future renewable energy adoption. CO2-EOR maximizes oil recovery and provides an attractive and commercially established technique to store CO2 underground. EOR modeling is crucial because complex simulation is required to predict the behavior of CO2 and its interaction with the oil and reservoir rock. EOR modeling can be enhanced by recent and rapid developments in data-driven approaches, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to improve speed, robustness, and accuracy in predicting CO2-EOR processes. Such enhancement in predictive accuracy may lead to more-efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable EOR processes, ensuring that the oil industry is capable of meeting growing global energy demand with reduced environmental impact.

Mature Fields and Revitalization-2025,https://jpt.spe.org/mature-fields-and-revitalization-2025,"What mature fields typically have in abundance are well, reservoir, and surface data. This data may be sporadic and of questionable quality but allows for valuable integration, corroboration, and multiple layers of quality checks before establishing any conclusions on revitalization performance metrics, targets for drilling, and estimates of reserves. From the papers reviewed, a spectrum of case studies addresses how practitioners are taking on the challenge of extending economic life and revitalization of mature fields through better understanding of the subsurface and adapting existing techniques and technologies in innovative ways. Targeted use of rate transient modeling has led to an elegant well-data-based understanding for ascertaining reasons for a lower-than-expected benchmarked recovery factor; mapping drainage areas and boundaries; and comparing well performances, allowing for low-cost and rigorous yet reasonably high-confidence outcomes. This can then be corroborated with any independent full-field, local, or well-modeling approach. There is a niche of modeling-focused workflows that allows for larger reservoir- and field-level uncertainties to be entertained in mapping the remaining oil. Such practices have been around in the shape of map-based exercises for locating the remaining oil, but the introduction of time-saving and efficient algorithms that integrate reservoir physics with statistics now can provide confidence levels in the maps of unswept and undrained hydrocarbons. At the larger scale of mature field opportunities, giant-fields revitalization projects provide an opportunity to start over to gain economically viable solutions. Given the specific challenges at hand, new technologies across well design, subsea, processing, and export infrastructure all are available to provide testimony to engineering innovation. In all the cases selected to showcase mature field and well revitalization, the key is to allow diverse teams to pilot ideas before expanding them to large-scale applications. Success can come from nonlinear ideas, and that makes working with large and diverse data so rewarding and beneficial.

Well Integrity-2025,https://jpt.spe.org/well-integrity-2025,"Ensuring efficient and robust engineering support for well integrity is essential for maintaining process safety and avoiding financially complex recoveries. At the same time, operators must address the challenge of optimizing plugging and abandonment costs through a proactive approach that integrates technology-driven solutions while upholding rigorous engineering standards. With the growing importance of carbon capture, it is encouraging to see that risk management for carbon storage aligns with the strength developed in source-control practices used for managing traditional hydrocarbons in subsea environments. Advancements in new technologies and rigorous testing methods have enabled the authors of the three SPE papers featured this year to outline a path forward, offering new possibilities that uphold the core objectives of safety and productivity. Paper SPE 217934 describes a study focused on evaluating experimental setups used to assess the hydraulic sealability of materials designed for zonal isolation. A detailed literature review revealed significant variations in methodologies applied by different researchers when testing annular cement and cement plugs. This diversity of approaches highlights a lack of consistency in experimental practices across the field. To improve the reliability and comparability of results, it is essential to establish standardized protocols and achieve consensus on key testing parameters. Paper IPTC 23330 shows how the adoption of advanced technologies for evaluating cement integrity behind multiple casing layers presents significant opportunities to optimize well timelines, reduce costs, and enhance capital efficiency. Safe well abandonment depends heavily on maintaining zonal isolation and cement integrity, which must be ensured across all casing strings. By implementing appropriate planning, execution, and continuous monitoring from the drilling phase through to abandonment, potential risks—such as gas migration to the surface—can be effectively minimized. Case studies discussed in this paper demonstrate the promising results of these new technologies, highlighting their value and justifying further refinement to enhance their performance in future applications. As the industry prioritizes decarbonization, offshore CO2 sequestration is emerging as a key solution, with subsea technologies likely to play a central role regardless of water depth or proximity to shore. Paper OTC 35246 explores these dynamics by leveraging a multiphase-flow simulator to study capping operations for CO2 well blowouts. This research marks a significant step forward in understanding the complexities of managing CO2 blowouts under subsea conditions. The simulator provided valuable insights into the unique behavior of CO2, including its tendency to form hydrates, which can complicate mitigation efforts. Additionally, the study highlighted the distinct risks posed by CO2 blowouts when compared with traditional hydrocarbon blowouts, emphasizing the need for specialized risk-management strategies. These findings are crucial for informing future offshore sequestration projects and improving safety protocols.

"Data Science, Analytics, and Artificial Intelligence",https://jpt.spe.org/data-science-analytics-and-artificial-intelligence,"Almost every day, petroleum engineers are coming to realize that they’ve got an arsenal of good ideas on how to leverage large, messy data sets to add value to their businesses. Those who have enlisted in the Analytics Army have progressed from siloed digitalization attempts to well-concerted digital transformation strategies that reflect high levels of organizational digital maturity. Paper SPE 220686hits an undeniable sweet spot for production and reservoir engineers, using an array of machine-learning methods to accurately predict real-time well status. Practicality here is evident, because only widely available surface-measured pressures, temperatures, and choke-valve positions are used to classify online and offline well status. The 99% accuracy levels achieved represent a boon not only for those interested in more-reliable rate allocation but also for well-integrity and flow-assurance applications. With ever-increasing data acquisition volumes, data-labeling and categorization problems increase in lockstep. After all, how well can your luggage be found without proper tagging? Anyone remember the 2022 summer of lost luggage? The value proposition of paper SPE 218865 is clear, using a combination of natural language processing for coiled tubing operations reports and pattern recognition of multimodal job data to automatically label the job types and technologies used. A myriad of other cases spring to mind for repurposing the solution to transform current onerous processes of metadata generation. In the aftermath of the explosion in popularity of all things generative artificial intelligence, paper SPE 217671 steals the limelight. This paper exploits good data foundations by painting a roadmap to building your own drilling chatbot adviser. Compared with other generalized large language models, the zero-shot learning technique allows the chatbot to answer queries for drilling domain-specific knowledge that it hasn’t explicitly “seen.” The authors have even publicized the training data sets collated from the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate to enable quick and relatively inexpensive replication.
